# Kubeflow Roadmap

## Kubeflow 1.7 Release, Planned: March 2023 
The Kubeflow Community plans to deliver its v1.7 release in March 2023, per this [timeline](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/573).   The high level deliveries are being tracked in this [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/kubeflow/projects/50/views/1).   The v1.7 release process will be managed by the v1.7 [Release Team](https://github.com/kubeflow/internal-acls/pull/576) using the best practices in the [Release Handbook](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/releases/handbook.md)

Notable feature candidates in the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/kubeflow/projects/50/views/1) are:
* Support for Kubernetes 1.25
* Improved user isolation especially for the Kubeflow pipelines user interface, database, and artifacts
* Update Kubeflow Notebooks naming from Notebooks to Workbenches
* Delivery of KFP V2 beta with its new front-end, backend and SDK 
* Simplified creation of Katib and Training Operator experiments using SDKs
* Simplified hyperparameter trial and log access from the Katib user interface.  Katib plans to add filtering and sorting of hyperparameter trial lists, and to speed user debugging by exposing logs from previous and running trials
* Distributed Training Operator support for PaddlePaddle

### Detailed features, bug fixes and enhancements are identified in these long term Working Group Roadmaps:

The 1.3 release plan includes the following features:

User Interface (UI) & Working Group enhancements to improve user experience and simplify workflows & operations

* Completely new UIs for KFServing, Katib, Tensorboard & Volumes Manager
* Notebooks
  * Important backend updates to Notebooks (i.e. to improve interop with Tensorboard)

* Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)
  * UI reorganization for better User Experience
  * Simplified view of dependency graphs
  * Multi-user feature enhancements in Kubeflow Pipelines
* KFServing v0.5
   * [Multi-model Serving](https://github.com/yuzliu/kfserving/blob/master/docs/MULTIMODELSERVING_GUIDE.md)
   * Ability to specify container fields on ML Framework spec such as env variable, liveness/readiness probes etc.
   * Ability to specify pod template fields on component spec such as NodeAffinity etc.
   * gRPC support Tensorflow Serving.
   * Triton Inference server V2 inference REST/gRPC protocol support
   * TorchServe predict integration
   * PyTorch Captum explain integration

## Kubeflow 1.1 Features, Release Date: Late June 2020

Kubeflow 1.1 will continue to enhance enterprise grade functionality for secure operations and upgrades.   1.1 will also simplify ML workflows to improve data scientist productivity.

The following features were delivered in Kubeflow 1.1:

* Additional security use cases for GCP users (including support for private GKE & Anthos Service Mesh),[design doc](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs); [#1705](https://github.com/kubeflow/website/issues/1705)
* A CVE scanning report and mitigation process, [4590](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4590)
* Improved workflow automation tools (fairing and kale) to simplify and mature the Core and EcoSystem supported CUJs

* Establishment of Kubeflow Policy / Guidelines on how to implement authorization in web applications. Propose SubjectAccessReview in order to use K8s RBAC as the source of truth for Authz. [4899](https://github.com/kubeflow/community#327)
* Guidelines on how cluster admins can interact with Kubeflow's authorization. There are already some difficulties with the self-serve model, process of adding contributors to a namespace and the way KFAM is using magic annotations on RoleBindings (#4574 #4889 #4936 #4924 #4938). Document current workarounds. [#4960](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4960)
* Decide when the CentralDashboard should show a namespace. Right now, this is done with KFAM in an error-prone way (magic annotations on RoleBindings). Design doc exploring different options (change KFAM to use SubjectAccessReview, use a model like GCP Console checking read permission on namespace, etc.) This is also related to item above. [#4960](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4960)
* Ability to turn off the self-serve mode, as in many environments there are mechanisms other than the Kubeflow Dashboard that provision/share an environment for/with the user. (#4942)
* Multi-User Authorization: Add support for K8s RBAC via SubjectAccessReview [#3513](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/3513)

The 1.1 features are tracked in this [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/kubeflow/projects/36) 

## Kubeflow 1.0
Kubeflow 1.0 was released on March 2, 2020. The 1.0 release consists of the following key pieces
* A core set of applications targeting the critical user journey of build-train-deploy
* Scaffolding to securely deploy and manage multi-user Kubeflow environments on-prem and in the cloud.
* A process to graduate Kubeflow components to a stable version based upon an Application Requirements definition that has been defined and validated by the Community’s testing process.

The following applications graduated to stable versions in Kubeflow 1.0.
* kfctl for deployment and upgrades
* TFJob and PyTorch for distributed training
* Jupyter notebook controller and web app
* Profile controller and UI for multiuser management

The following applications are considered in a beta version in Kubeflow 1.0.

# Kubeflow 2019 roadmap

The roadmap provides a high level overview of key areas that will likely span multiple releases.

The roadmap provides links to critical user journeys(CUJs) that we want to deliver.
A CUJ shows how a user would accomplish some critical task (for example build, train, and deploy a model).

Kubeflow does a major release at the end of every quarter. Minor releases occur as needed to fix important bugs.

For detailed information about what will be in a release look
for the issues tagged "area/X.Y.Z".
