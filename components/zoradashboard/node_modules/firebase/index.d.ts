   * - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a

   * - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not
   *   in a state required for the operation's execution.
   * - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency
   *   issue like transaction aborts, etc.
   * - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range.
   * - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled.
   * - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by
   *   underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors,
   *   something is very broken.
   * - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely
   *   a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff.

     * - there is a query in effect which now filters out the child (because it's
     *   sort order changed or the max limit was hit)
     *
     * <h4>child_changed event</h4>
     *
     * This event will be triggered when the data stored in a child (or any of its
     * descendants) changes. Note that a single `child_changed` event may represent
     * multiple changes to the child. The `DataSnapshot` passed to the callback will
     * contain the new child contents. For ordering purposes, the callback is also
     * passed a second argument which is a string containing the key of the previous
     * sibling child by sort order, or `null` if it is the first child.
     *
     * <h4>child_moved event</h4>
     *
     * This event will be triggered when a child's sort order changes such that its
     * position relative to its siblings changes. The `DataSnapshot` passed to the
     * callback will be for the data of the child that has moved. It is also passed
     * a second argument which is a string containing the key of the previous
     * sibling child by sort order, or `null` if it is the first child.
     *
     * @example **Handle a new value:**
     * ```javascript
     * ref.on('value', function(dataSnapshot) {
     *   ...
     * });

     * Atomically modifies the data at this location.
     *
     * Atomically modify the data at this location. Unlike a normal `set()`, which
     * just overwrites the data regardless of its previous value, `transaction()` is
     * used to modify the existing value to a new value, ensuring there are no
     * conflicts with other clients writing to the same location at the same time.
     *
     * To accomplish this, you pass `transaction()` an update function which is used
     * to transform the current value into a new value. If another client writes to
     * the location before your new value is successfully written, your update
     * function will be called again with the new current value, and the write will
     * be retried. This will happen repeatedly until your write succeeds without
     * conflict or you abort the transaction by not returning a value from your
     * update function.
     *
     * Note: Modifying data with `set()` will cancel any pending transactions at
     * that location, so extreme care should be taken if mixing `set()` and
     * `transaction()` to update the same data.
     *
     * Note: When using transactions with Security and Firebase Rules in place, be
     * aware that a client needs `.read` access in addition to `.write` access in
     * order to perform a transaction. This is because the client-side nature of
     * transactions requires the client to read the data in order to transactionally
     * update it.
     *
     * @example
     * ```javascript
     * // Increment Ada's rank by 1.
     * var adaRankRef = firebase.database().ref('users/ada/rank');
     * adaRankRef.transaction(function(currentRank) {
     *   // If users/ada/rank has never been set, currentRank will be `null`.
     *   return currentRank + 1;
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * @example
     * ```javascript
     * // Try to create a user for ada, but only if the user id 'ada' isn't
     * // already taken
     * var adaRef = firebase.database().ref('users/ada');
     * adaRef.transaction(function(currentData) {
     *   if (currentData === null) {
     *     return { name: { first: 'Ada', last: 'Lovelace' } };
     *   } else {
     *     console.log('User ada already exists.');
     *     return; // Abort the transaction.
     *   }
     * }, function(error, committed, snapshot) {
     *   if (error) {
     *     console.log('Transaction failed abnormally!', error);
     *   } else if (!committed) {
     *     console.log('We aborted the transaction (because ada already exists).');
     *   } else {
     *     console.log('User ada added!');
     *   }
     *   console.log("Ada's data: ", snapshot.val());
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * @param transactionUpdate A developer-supplied function which
     *   will be passed the current data stored at this location (as a JavaScript
     *   object). The function should return the new value it would like written (as
     *   a JavaScript object). If `undefined` is returned (i.e. you return with no
     *   arguments) the transaction will be aborted and the data at this location
     *   will not be modified.
     * @param onComplete A callback
     *   function that will be called when the transaction completes. The callback
     *   is passed three arguments: a possibly-null `Error`, a `boolean` indicating
     *   whether the transaction was committed, and a `DataSnapshot` indicating the
     *   final result. If the transaction failed abnormally, the first argument will
     *   be an `Error` object indicating the failure cause. If the transaction
     *   finished normally, but no data was committed because no data was returned
     *   from `transactionUpdate`, then second argument will be false. If the
     *   transaction completed and committed data to Firebase, the second argument
     *   will be true. Regardless, the third argument will be a `DataSnapshot`
     *   containing the resulting data in this location.
     * @param applyLocally By default, events are raised each time the
     *   transaction update function runs. So if it is run multiple times, you may
     *   see intermediate states. You can set this to false to suppress these
     *   intermediate states and instead wait until the transaction has completed
     *   before events are raised.
     * @return Returns a Promise that can optionally be used instead of the onComplete
     *   callback to handle success and failure.

   *   exists.
   * - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the
   *   specified operation.
   * - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a

   * - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not
   *   in a state required for the operation's execution.
   * - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency
   *   issue like transaction aborts, etc.
   * - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range.
   * - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled.
   * - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by

   *   something is very broken.
   * - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely
