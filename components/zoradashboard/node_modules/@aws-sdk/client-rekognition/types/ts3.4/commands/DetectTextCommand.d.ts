/**
 * <p>Detects text in the input image and converts it into machine-readable text.</p>
 *          <p>Pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an
 *       Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, you must pass it as a
 *       reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. For the AWS CLI, passing image bytes is not
 *       supported. The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file. </p>
 *          <p>The <code>DetectText</code> operation returns text in an array of <a>TextDetection</a> elements, <code>TextDetections</code>. Each
 *         <code>TextDetection</code> element provides information about a single word or line of text
 *       that was detected in the image. </p>
 *          <p>A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not separated by spaces.
 *         <code>DetectText</code> can detect up to 50 words in an image.</p>
 *          <p>A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete
 *       sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there
 *       is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words,
 *       relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition
 *       may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the
 *       end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the <code>DetectText</code> operation
 *       returns multiple lines.</p>
 *          <p>To determine whether a <code>TextDetection</code> element is a line of text or a word,
 *       use the <code>TextDetection</code> object <code>Type</code> field. </p>
 *          <p>To be detected, text must be within +/- 90 degrees orientation of the horizontal axis.</p>
 *
 *          <p>For more information, see DetectText in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p>
