/**
 * Utility class used to serialize and deserialize event streams in
 * browsers and ReactNative.
 *
 * In browsers where ReadableStream API is available:
 * * deserialize from ReadableStream to an async iterable of output structure
 * * serialize from async iterable of input structure to ReadableStream
 * In ReactNative where only async iterable API is available:
 * * deserialize from async iterable of binaries to async iterable of output structure
 * * serialize from async iterable of input structure to async iterable of binaries
 *
 * We use ReadableStream API in browsers because of the consistency with other
 * streaming operations, where ReadableStream API is used to denote streaming data.
 * Whereas in ReactNative, ReadableStream API is not available, we use async iterable
 * for streaming data although it has lower throughput.
