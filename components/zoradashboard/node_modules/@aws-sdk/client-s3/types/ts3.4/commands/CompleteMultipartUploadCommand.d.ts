/**
 * <p>Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.</p>
 *          <p>You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>
 *          operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this
 *          operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all
 *          the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete
 *          Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts
 *          list is complete. This operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For
 *          each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the <code>ETag</code> value,
 *          returned after that part was uploaded.</p>
 *          <p>Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to
 *          complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that
 *          specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white
 *          space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after
 *          the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body
 *          to determine whether the request succeeded.</p>
 *          <p>Note that if <code>CompleteMultipartUpload</code> fails, applications should be prepared
 *          to retry the failed requests. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ErrorBestPractices.html">Amazon S3 Error Best Practices</a>.</p>

 *             Upload</a>.</p>
