/**
 * <p>This operation is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have permission to
 *          access it. The operation returns a <code>200 OK</code> if the bucket exists and you have
 *          permission to access it. Otherwise, the operation might return responses such as <code>404
 *             Not Found</code> and <code>403 Forbidden</code>. </p>
 *
 *          <p>To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
 *             <code>s3:ListBucket</code> action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and
 *          can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources">Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html">Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
