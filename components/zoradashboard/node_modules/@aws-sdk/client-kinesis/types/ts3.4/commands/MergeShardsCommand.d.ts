/**
 * <p>Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single
 *             shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. Two shards are
 *             considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a
 *             contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key
 *             range of 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could
 *             merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range of
 *             276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key values
 *             covered by the two parent shards.</p>
 *         <p>
 *             <code>MergeShards</code> is called when there is a need to reduce the overall capacity
 *             of a stream because of excess capacity that is not being used. You must specify the
 *             shard to be merged and the adjacent shard for a stream. For more information about
 *             merging shards, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-merge.html">Merge Two
 *                 Shards</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer
 *                 Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <p>If the stream is in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state, you can call
 *                 <code>MergeShards</code>. If a stream is in the <code>CREATING</code>,
 *                 <code>UPDATING</code>, or <code>DELETING</code> state, <code>MergeShards</code>
 *             returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>. If the specified stream does not exist,
 *                 <code>MergeShards</code> returns a <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>. </p>
 *         <p>You can use <a>DescribeStream</a> to check the state of the stream,
 *             which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>.</p>
 *         <p>
 *             <code>MergeShards</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a
 *                 <code>MergeShards</code> request, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a
 *             response and sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the
 *             operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to
 *                 <code>ACTIVE</code>. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is
 *             in the <code>UPDATING</code> state. </p>
 *         <p>You use <a>DescribeStream</a> to determine the shard IDs that are
 *             specified in the <code>MergeShards</code> request. </p>
 *         <p>If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using <a>CreateStream</a>, <a>DeleteStream</a>, <code>MergeShards</code>,
 *             or <a>SplitShard</a>, you receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code>. </p>
 *         <p>
 *             <code>MergeShards</code> has a limit of five transactions per second per
 *             account.</p>
