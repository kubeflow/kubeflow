/**
 * A `Timestamp` represents a point in time independent of any time zone or
 * calendar, represented as seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
 * resolution in UTC Epoch time.
 *
 * It is encoded using the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the
 * Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes
 * are 60 seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second
 * table is needed for interpretation. Range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to
 * 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z.
 *
 * For examples and further specifications, refer to the
 * {@link https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto | Timestamp definition}.
