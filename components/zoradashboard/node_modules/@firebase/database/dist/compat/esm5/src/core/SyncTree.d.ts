/**
 * SyncTree is the central class for managing event callback registration, data caching, views
 * (query processing), and event generation.  There are typically two SyncTree instances for
 * each Repo, one for the normal Firebase data, and one for the .info data.
 *
 * It has a number of responsibilities, including:
 *  - Tracking all user event callbacks (registered via addEventRegistration() and removeEventRegistration()).
 *  - Applying and caching data changes for user set(), transaction(), and update() calls
 *    (applyUserOverwrite(), applyUserMerge()).
 *  - Applying and caching data changes for server data changes (applyServerOverwrite(),
 *    applyServerMerge()).
 *  - Generating user-facing events for server and user changes (all of the apply* methods
 *    return the set of events that need to be raised as a result).
 *  - Maintaining the appropriate set of server listens to ensure we are always subscribed
 *    to the correct set of paths and queries to satisfy the current set of user event
 *    callbacks (listens are started/stopped using the provided listenProvider).
 *
 * NOTE: Although SyncTree tracks event callbacks and calculates events to raise, the actual
 * events are returned to the caller rather than raised synchronously.
