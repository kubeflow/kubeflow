 * The event queue serves a few purposes:
 * 1. It ensures we maintain event order in the face of event callbacks doing operations that result in more
 *    events being queued.
 * 2. raiseQueuedEvents() handles being called reentrantly nicely.  That is, if in the course of raising events,
 *    raiseQueuedEvents() is called again, the "inner" call will pick up raising events where the "outer" call
 *    left off, ensuring that the events are still raised synchronously and in order.
 * 3. You can use raiseEventsAtPath and raiseEventsForChangedPath to ensure only relevant previously-queued
 *    events are raised synchronously.
 *
 * NOTE: This can all go away if/when we move to async events.
