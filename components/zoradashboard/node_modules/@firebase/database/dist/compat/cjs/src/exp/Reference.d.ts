/**
 * A `Query` sorts and filters the data at a Database location so only a subset
 * of the child data is included. This can be used to order a collection of
 * data by some attribute (for example, height of dinosaurs) as well as to
 * restrict a large list of items (for example, chat messages) down to a number
 * suitable for synchronizing to the client. Queries are created by chaining
 * together one or more of the filter methods defined here.
 *
 * Just as with a `Reference`, you can receive data from a `Query` by using the
 * `on*()` methods. You will only receive events and `DataSnapshot`s for the
 * subset of the data that matches your query.
 *
 * See {@link https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/lists-of-data#sorting_and_filtering_data}
 * for more information.
