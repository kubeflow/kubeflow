 * Atomically modifies the data at this location.
 *
 * Atomically modify the data at this location. Unlike a normal `set()`, which
 * just overwrites the data regardless of its previous value, `transaction()` is
 * used to modify the existing value to a new value, ensuring there are no
 * conflicts with other clients writing to the same location at the same time.
 *
 * To accomplish this, you pass `runTransaction()` an update function which is
 * used to transform the current value into a new value. If another client
 * writes to the location before your new value is successfully written, your
 * update function will be called again with the new current value, and the
 * write will be retried. This will happen repeatedly until your write succeeds
 * without conflict or you abort the transaction by not returning a value from
 * your update function.
 *
 * Note: Modifying data with `set()` will cancel any pending transactions at
 * that location, so extreme care should be taken if mixing `set()` and
 * `transaction()` to update the same data.
 *
 * Note: When using transactions with Security and Firebase Rules in place, be
 * aware that a client needs `.read` access in addition to `.write` access in
 * order to perform a transaction. This is because the client-side nature of
 * transactions requires the client to read the data in order to transactionally
 * update it.
 *
 * @param ref - The location to atomically modify.
 * @param transactionUpdate - A developer-supplied function which will be passed
 * the current data stored at this location (as a JavaScript object). The
 * function should return the new value it would like written (as a JavaScript
 * object). If `undefined` is returned (i.e. you return with no arguments) the
 * transaction will be aborted and the data at this location will not be
 * modified.
 * @param options - An options object to configure transactions.
 * @returns A Promise that can optionally be used instead of the onComplete
 * callback to handle success and failure.
