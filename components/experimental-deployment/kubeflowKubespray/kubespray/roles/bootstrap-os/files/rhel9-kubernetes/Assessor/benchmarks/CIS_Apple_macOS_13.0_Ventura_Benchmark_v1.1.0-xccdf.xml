This document, CIS Apple macOS 13.0 Ventura Benchmark, provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Apple macOS 13.0 Ventura. This guide was tested against Apple macOS 13.0 Ventura. To obtain the latest version of this guide, please visit       <xhtml:a href="http://benchmarks.cisecurity.org">http://benchmarks.cisecurity.org</xhtml:a>
. If you have questions, comments, or have identified ways to improve this guide, please write us at       <xhtml:a href="mailto:feedback@cisecurity.org">feedback@cisecurity.org</xhtml:a>
.    </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>This Benchmark includes instructions for auditing and remediation containing three different methods: Graphical User Interface (GUI), Command Line Interface using Terminal (CLI), and Configuration Profiles. These may be used to evaluate current configuration status and make changes as desired. In most cases, all methods are supported by the Operating System and it is up to organizational implementation personnel on how best to implement. There are some recommendations that can only be managed through one of these methods. Each organization must decide if control management outside their standard process is required if no solution is possible through their organization's specific choice of implementation. It is best practice at this time for Enterprise-managed devices to use profiles for management. A mix of both profile device management and command line hardening scripts will be the most comprehensive solution.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>With the functionality of mobile configuration profiles, there has been an update to several recommendations. Any recommendation that is user specific but has a profile that sets a system-wide setting are compliant only with the profile installed. Any user specific settings have been moved to the Additional Information section but will no longer pass the audit.</xhtml:p>

      </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>Organizations that are using profiles should remember that a profile can limit what, if any, settings can be changed based on the profile payload. Even authorized organization technical personnel may not be able to change a setting with a profile in place. If technical personnel are expected to make changes that are contrary to profile settings, the profile may need to be reviewed in order to verify which accounts and what conditions apply, or a process to temporarily remove the profile should be in place.</xhtml:p>

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

Some environments will want to approve and test updates before they are delivered. It is best practice to test first where updates can and have caused disruptions to operations. Automatic updates should be turned off where changes are tightly controlled and there are mature testing and approval processes. Automatic updates should not be turned off simply to allow the administrator to contact users in order to verify installation. A dependable, repeatable process involving a patch agent or remote management tool should be in place before auto-updates are turned off.</xhtml:p>

The use of an Apple ID allows for a consistent access and experience across all Apple devices. An Apple ID functions as Single Sign-On access to all Apple provided services.

               <xhtml:p>iCloud is Apple's service for synchronizing, storing, and backing up data from Apple applications in both macOS and iOS.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>macOS controls for iCloud are part of the Apple ID settings in macOS. The configuration options in macOS resemble the options in iOS.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Apple's iCloud is a consumer-oriented service that allows a user to store data as well as find, control, and back up devices that are associated with their Apple ID (Apple account). The use of iCloud on Enterprise devices should align with the acceptable use policy for devices that are managed, as well as confidentiality requirements for data handled by the user. If iCloud is allowed, the data that is copied to Apple servers will likely be duplicated on both personal as well as Enterprise devices.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>For many users, the Enterprise email system may replace many of the available features in iCloud. Calendars, notes, and contacts can sync to the official Enterprise repository and be available through multiple devices if using either an Exchange or Google environment email.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Depending on workplace requirements, it may not be appropriate to intermingle Enterprise and personal bookmarks, photos, and documents. Since the service allows every device associated with the user's ID to synchronize and have access to the cloud storage, the concern is not just about having sensitive data on Apple's servers, but also having that same data on the phone of the teenage son or daughter of an employee. The use of family sharing options can reduce the risk.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Apple's iCloud is just one of many cloud-based solutions being used for data synchronization across multiple platforms, and it should be controlled consistently with other cloud services in your environment. Work with your employees and configure the access to best enable data protection for your mission.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The iCloud keychain is Apple's password manager that works with macOS and iOS. The capability allows users to store passwords in either iOS or macOS for use in Safari on both platforms and other iOS-integrated applications. The most pervasive use is driven by iOS use rather than macOS. The passwords stored in a macOS keychain on an Enterprise-managed computer could be stored in Apple's cloud and then be available on a personal computer using the same account. The stored passwords could be for organizational as well as for personal accounts.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>If passwords are no longer being used as organizational tokens, they are not in scope for iCloud keychain storage.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>With macOS 10.12, Apple introduced the capability to have a user's Desktop and Documents folders automatically synchronize to the user's iCloud Drive, provided they have enough room purchased through Apple on their iCloud Drive. This capability mirrors what Microsoft is doing with the use of OneDrive and Office 365. There are concerns with using this capability.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The storage space that Apple provides for free is used by users with iCloud mail, all of a user's Photo Library created with the ever larger Multi-Pixel iPhone cameras, and all iOS Backups. Adding a synchronization capability for users who have files going back a decade or more, storage may be tight using the free 5GB provided without purchasing much larger storage capacity from Apple. Users with multiple computers running 10.12 and above with unique content on each will have issues as well.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Enterprise users may not be allowed to store Enterprise information in a third-party public cloud. In previous implementations, such as iCloud Drive or DropBox, the user selected what files were synchronized even if there were no other controls. The new feature synchronizes all files in a folder widely used to put working files.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The automatic synchronization of all files in a user's Desktop and Documents folders should be disabled.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>With OS X 10.11, Apple added settings for password storage for the App Store in macOS. These settings parallel the settings in iOS. As with iOS, the choices are a requirement to provide a password after every purchase or to have a 15-minute grace period, and whether or not to require a password for free purchases. The response to this setting is stored in a cookie and processed by iCloud.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>There is plenty of risk information on the wisdom of this setting for parents with children buying games on iPhones and iPads. The most relevant information here is the likelihood that users who are not authorized to download software may have physical access to an unlocked computer where someone who is authorized recently made a purchase. If that is a concern, a password should be required at all times for App Store access in the Password Settings controls.</xhtml:p>

 pane includes the firewall settings. macOS has a built-in firewall that has two main configuration aspects. Both the Application Layer Firewall (ALF) and the Packet Filter Firewall (PF) can be used to secure running ports and services on a Mac. The Application Firewall is the one accessible in System Preferences under security. The PF firewall contains many more capabilities than ALF, but also requires a greater understanding of firewall recipes and rule configurations. For standard use cases on a Mac, the PF firewall is not necessary. macOS may expose server services that are reachable remotely, but that is not the primary use case or design. If custom use cases are required, the PF firewall can provide additional security. Macs that are used as mobile desktops do not need to use the PF firewall capabilities unless permanently open ports need to be protected with more granular IP access controls.        </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>AirDrop is Apple's built-in on demand ad hoc file exchange system that is compatible with both macOS and iOS. It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are nearby to each other.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>In many ways this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be enabled when needed and disabled afterwards. The recommendation against enabling the sharing is not based on any known lack of security in the protocol but for specific user operational concerns.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>If AirDrop is enabled the Mac is advertising that a Mac is addressable on the local network and open to either unwanted AirDrop upload requests or for a negotiation on whether the remote user is in the user's contacts list Neither process is desirable.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>In most known use cases AirDrop use is ad hoc networking where AirDrop use is where Apple device users decide that a file should be exchanged and opt to use AirDrop which can be abled on the fly for that exchange.</xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:p>For organizations concerned about any use of AirDrop because of Digital Loss Prevention (DLP) monitoring on other protocols JAMF has an article on reviewing AirDrop logs.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>In macOS Monterey (12.0), Apple has added the capability to share content from another Apple device to the screen of a host Mac. While there are many valuable uses of this capability, such sharing on a standard Mac user workstation should be enabled ad hoc as required rather than allowing a continuous sharing service. The feature can be restricted by Apple ID or network and is configured to use by accepting the connection on the Mac. Part of the concern is frequent connection requests may function as a denial-of-service and access control limits may provide too much information to an attacker.</xhtml:p>

 If your organization has internal time servers, enter them here. Enterprise mobile devices may need to use a mix of internal and external time servers. If multiple servers are required, use the Date &amp; Time System Preference with each server separated by a space.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Additional Note:</xhtml:strong>
 The default Apple time server is time.apple.com. Variations include time.euro.apple.com. While it is certainly more efficient to use internal time servers, there is no reason to block access to global Apple time servers or to add a time.apple.com alias to internal DNS records. There are no reports that Apple gathers any information from NTP synchronization, as the computers already phone home to Apple for Apple services including iCloud use and software updates. Best practice is to allow DNS resolution to an authoritative time service for time.apple.com, preferably to connect to Apple servers, but local servers are acceptable as well.            </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries. Ensure that time on the computer is within acceptable limits. Truly accurate time is measured within milliseconds. For this audit, a drift under four and a half minutes passes the control check. Since Kerberos is one of the important features of macOS integration into Directory systems, the guidance here is to warn you before there could be an impact to operations. From the perspective of accurate time, this check is not strict, so it may be too great for your organization. Your organization can adjust to a smaller offset value as needed.</xhtml:p>

Help desks use graphical remote tools to understand what the user sees and assist them so they can get back to work. For MacOS, some of these remote capabilities can use Apple's OS tools. Control is therefore not meant to prohibit the use of a just-in-time graphical view from authorized personnel with authentication controls.

                  <xhtml:p>Apple's File Sharing uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to share to other computers that can mount SMB shares. This includes other macOS computers.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Apple warns that SMB sharing stored passwords is less secure, and anyone with system access can gain access to the password for that account. When sharing with SMB, each user accessing the Mac must have SMB enabled. Storing passwords, especially copies of valid directory passwords, decrease security for the directory account and should not be used.</xhtml:p>

macOS does have an IP-based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Network</xhtml:span>

Since most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP-based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server.            </xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:p class="bold">Impact:</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>The SSH server built into macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications, including email, web browser, and productivity tools, should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management toolsets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate administrator service accounts.</xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions, there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:</xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:ul>
                              <xhtml:li>Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account, they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication, directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.</xhtml:li>
                              <xhtml:li>Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key, they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.</xhtml:li>
                              <xhtml:li>Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks, but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark.</xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:p>Remote Management is the client portion of Apple Remote Desktop (ARD). Remote Management can be used by remote administrators to view the current screen, install software, report on, and generally manage client Macs.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The screen sharing options in Remote Management are identical to those in the Screen Sharing section. In fact, only one of the two can be configured. If Remote Management is used, refer to the Screen Sharing section above on issues regard screen sharing.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Remote Management should only be enabled when a Directory is in place to manage the accounts with access. Computers will be available on port 5900 on a macOS System and could accept connections from untrusted hosts depending on the configuration, which is a major concern for mobile systems. As with other sharing options, an open port even for authorized management functions can be attacked, and both unauthorized access and Denial-of-Service vulnerabilities could be exploited. If remote management is required, the pf firewall should restrict access only to known, trusted management consoles. Remote management should not be used across the Internet without the use of a VPN tunnel.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra), Apple introduced a service to make it easier to deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints or greater bandwidth exist on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets, the effectiveness of this capability would be determined by how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new, large updates were made available upstream.
This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity and bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk, they add to the management complexity. Since the value of the service is in specific use cases organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Starting with macOS 10.15, Apple has provided a control which permits a user to share Apple downloaded content on all Apple devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID.

                  <xhtml:p>With this capability, guest users can also use media downloaded on the computer.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The recommended best practice is not to use the computer as a server, but to utilize Apple's cloud storage in order to download and use content stored there if content stored with Apple is used on multiple devices.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>If the computer is used in an organization that assigns host names, it is a good idea to change the computer name to the host name. This is more of a best practice than a security measure. If the host name and the computer name are the same, computer support may be able to track problems down more easily.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
For organizations or for users that self-administer their own computers, it is important to not use sensitive or personal information in computer names. The name of a computer that uses untrusted networks will be exposed at a minimum to the responsible network team of that network. For instance, having your name as your               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">hostname</xhtml:span>
 can provide useful knowledge to an attacker monitoring the network you may be connected to.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Examples of possibly inappropriate content in computer names include:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>User directory account names</xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:p>With mobile devices, using DHCP IP tracking has serious drawbacks; hostname or computer name tracking makes much more sense for those organizations that can implement it.

               <xhtml:p>One of the most important IT Operational concerns is to ensure that information is protected against loss or tampering. The purpose of the IT devices is to process the data, after all. At one time the cost of IT equipment and the volume of the data might make protection of the equipment itself more important. At this point, the vast size of data archives and the lower cost of end-user equipment makes data protection central to operational planning. Backup strategies are generally focused on ensuring that there are multiple copies of relevant versions of user files. The plan is that no single hardware or software loss or failure will result in major data loss.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Apple does not provide a native remote logging capability that encrypts data in transit (DIT). If no third party tool or agent is installed on organizational-manned Macs, it is even more important to ensure that backup processes are implemented with log backups as part of the architecture.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>In recent years the criticality of information backup, protection of data, and data backups has become even more important with the rise of cybercriminals that not only commit denial-of-service attacks using ransomware to encrypt your working data to make it inaccessible, but also encrypt the backups if reachable. Newer threats include blackmail to compromise data confidentiality. A comprehensive plan to protect data from compromise is even more vital with current threats. The Time Machine controls are only recommended best practices to assist in ease of frequent backups and the encryption of backup volumes.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Apple introduced Time Machine in 2007 as a simple-to-use, built-in mechanism for users to ensure that their machine was backed up, and if there was a mistake or loss, that information could be easily recovered. There are other solutions to ensure information is protected, including several Enterprise solutions and simple drive or directory cloning.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The controls in this section are specifically about Time Machine. The general ideas are applicable to any data backup solution. These controls are only pertinent to organizations already using Time Machine as part of their backup solutions to ensure the included Apple backup solution is being used effectively. We are not endorsing that Time Machine should be used exclusively or as part of the Enterprise backup solution. The controls first check that Time Machine is actually enabled.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>One of the most important security tools for data protection on macOS is FileVault. With encryption in place it makes it difficult for an outside party to access your data if they get physical possession of the computer. One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting-up a Time Machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>With macOS 10.12 Sierra, Apple has introduced Siri from iOS to macOS. While there are data spillage concerns with the use of data-gathering personal assistant software, the risk here does not seem greater in sending queries to Apple through Siri than in sending search terms in a browser to Google or Microsoft. While it is possible that Siri will be used for local actions rather than Internet searches, Siri could, in theory, tell Apple about confidential Programs and Projects that should not be revealed. This appears be a usage edge case.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>In cases where sensitive or protected data is processed and Siri could expose that information through assisting a user in navigating their machine, it should be disabled. Siri does need to phone home to Apple, so it should not be available from air-gapped networks as part of its requirements.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Most of the use case data published has shown that Siri is a tremendous time saver on iOS where multiple screens and menus need to be navigated through. Information like sports scores, weather, movie times, and simple to-do items on existing calendars can be easily found with Siri. None of the standard use cases should be more risky than already approved activity.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>If the computer is present in an area where there are privacy concerns or sensitive activity is taking place, the Mac should be configured appropriately for the sensitive area.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Camera:
If the computer is present in an area where there are privacy concerns or sensitive activity is taking place, the camera should be covered at those times. A permanent cover or alteration may be required when the computer is always located in a confidential area.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Microphone:
If the computer is present in an area where there are privacy concerns or sensitive activity is taking place, the microphone input should be set to zero in the input tab of the Sound preference pane at those times. Individual management of applications with access to the microphone may be managed in the Security &amp; Privacy Preference Pane under Microphone.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>WiFi and Bluetooth
Some organizations have comprehensive rules that cover the use of wireless technologies in order to implement operational security. There are often specific policies governing the use of both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (802.11) that may include disabling the wireless capability in either software or hardware or both. Wireless access is part of the feature set required for mobile computers and is considered essential for most users.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
Malware is continuously discovered that circumvents the privacy controls of the built-in Video, audio or network capabilities. No computer has perfect security, and even if all the drivers are disabled or removed, working drivers can be reintroduced by a determined attacker.

                  <xhtml:p>macOS uses location information gathered through local Wi-Fi networks to enable applications to supply relevant information to users. With the operating system verifying the location, users do not need to change the time or the time zone. The computer will change them based on the user's location. They do not need to specify their location for weather or travel times, and they will receive alerts on travel times to meetings and appointment where location information is supplied.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Ensure applications that can use Location Services are authorized and provide that information where the application interacts with external systems.

               <xhtml:p>Apple provides a framework that allows advertisers to target Apple users and end-users with advertisements. While many people prefer to see advertising that is relevant to them and their interests, the detailed information that is collected, correlated, and available to advertisers in repositories via data mining is often disconcerting. This information is valuable to both advertisers and attackers, and has been used with other metadata to reveal users' identities.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Organizations should manage advertising settings on computers rather than allow users to configure the settings.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>FileVault may not be desirable on a virtual OS. As long as the hypervisor and file storage are encrypted, the virtual OS does not need to be. Rather than checking if the OS is virtual and passing the control regardless of the encryption of the host system, the normal check will be run. Security officials can evaluate the comprehensive controls outside of the OS being tested.</xhtml:p>

Part of FileVault management in an Enterprise environment is to ensure key management if technical staff need to decrypt encrypted volumes. More information here:

Advanced attackers are of more concern and a risk review to understand organizational targets and use Lockdown Mode where appropriate is necessary.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Universal Control is an Apple feature that allows Mac users to control multiple other Macs and iPads with the same keyboard, mouse, and trackpad using the same Apple ID. The technology relies on already available iCloud services, particularly Handoff.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Universal Control simplifies the use of iCloud connectivity of multiple computers using the same Apple ID. This may simplify data transfer from organizationally-managed and personal devices. The use of the same iCloud account and Handoff is the underlying concern that should be evaluated. The use of the same keyboard or mouse across multiple devices does not by itself decrease organizational security.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it were not encrypted. When the system is not in use, the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept, there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on, as well as USB or other open device ports, are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer, encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it were not encrypted. When the system is not in use, the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/">https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/</xhtml:a>
                  </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for "standbydelay" is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Macs running Apple silicon chips, rather than Intel chips, do not require the same configuration as Intel-based Macs.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept, there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on, as well as USB or other open device ports, are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer, encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.</xhtml:p>

Where mobile workstations and agents exist, the device will more likely check in to receive updates when already awake.

               <xhtml:p>A locking screen saver is one of the standard security controls to limit access to a computer and the current user's session when the computer is temporarily unused or unattended. In macOS, the screen saver starts after a value is selected in the drop-down menu. 20 minutes or less is an acceptable value. Any value can be selected through the command line or script, but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Apple has integrated Touch ID with macOS and allows fingerprint use for many common operations. All use of Touch ID requires the presence of a password and the use of that password after every reboot, or when more than 48 hours has elapsed since the device was last unlocked. Touch ID is not a password replacement, the use of Touch ID can make the use of passwords more secure for authorized users with physical access to a Mac. Normal day-to-day work operations can eliminate the use of console password entry unless a reboot is required other than on Monday morning. The infrequency of password screen unlock can enable a more complicated pass phrase that is seldom used, when Touch ID is used it remediates the risk of shoulder surfing (including video surveillance) to capture console credentials. There have been many reported shoulder surfing password captures on iOS devices, reports have not been widespread on Macs but shoulder surfing password capture is simpler than the other methods of breaking in to an encrypted Mac.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>When a SmartCard or YubiKey is provisioned by an organization and is available for Console authentication that is a much more secure option than the use of Touch ID and is preferred.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Account management is a central part of security for any computer system, including macOS. General practices should be followed to ensure that all accounts on a system are still needed, and that default accounts have been removed. Users with administrator roles should have distinct accounts for both administrator functions as well as day-to-day work where the passwords are different and known only by the user assigned to the account. Accounts with elevated privileges should not be easily discerned from the account name from standard accounts.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>When any computer system is added to a directory system there are additional controls available, including user account management, that are not available in a standalone computer. One of the drawbacks is the local computer is no longer in control of the accounts that can access or manage it if given permission. For macOS, if the computer is connected to a directory, any standard user can now log into the computer at console, which by default may be desirable or not depending on the use case. If an administrator group is allowed to administer the local computer, the membership of that group is controlled completely in the directory.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>macOS computers connected to a directory should be configured so that the risk is appropriate for the mission use of the computer. Only those accounts that require local authentication should be allowed, and only required administrator accounts should be in the local administrator group. Authenticated users for console access and domain admins for administration may be too broad or too limited.</xhtml:p>

         <xhtml:p>This section provides guidance on configuring the logging and auditing facilities available in macOS. Starting with macOS 10.12, Apple introduced unified logging. This capability replaces the previous logging methodology with centralized, system-wide common controls. A full explanation of macOS logging behavior is beyond the scope of this Benchmark. These changes impact previous logging controls from macOS Benchmarks. At this point, many of the syslog controls have been or are being removed since the old logging methods have been deprecated. Controls that still appear useful will be retained. Some legacy controls have been removed for this release.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>
macOS writes information pertaining to system-related events to the file           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/install.log</xhtml:span>
 and has a configurable retention policy for this file. The default logging setting limits the file size of the logs and the maximum size for all logs. The default allows for an errant application to fill the log files and does not enforce sufficient log retention. The Benchmark recommends a value based on standard use cases. The value should align with local requirements within the organization.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The default value has an "all_max" file limitation, no reference to a minimum retention, and a less precise rotation argument.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The all_max flag control will remove old log entries based only on the size of the log files. Log size can vary widely depending on how verbose installing applications are in their log entries. The decision here is to ensure that logs go back a year, and depending on the applications a size restriction could compromise the ability to store a full year.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>While this Benchmark is not scoring for a rotation flag, the default rotation is sequential rather than using a timestamp. Auditors may prefer timestamps in order to simply review specific dates where event information is desired.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Please review the File Rotation section in the man page for more information.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:li>An organization appropriate retention should be added "ttl="</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>The rotation should be set with timestamps "rotate=utc" or "rotate=local"</xhtml:li>

            <xhtml:p>Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly-configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of "I'm here!" messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers. This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices, the pf or other firewall would be needed.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>By default, macOS allows all valid users into the top level of every other user's home folder and restricts access to the Apple default folders within. Another user on the same system can see you have a "Documents" folder but cannot see inside it. This configuration does work for personal file sharing but can expose user files to standard accounts on the system.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The best parallel for Enterprise environments is that everyone who has a Dropbox account can see everything that is at the top level but can't see your pictures. Similarly with macOS, users can see into every new Directory that is created because of the default permissions.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Home folders should be restricted to access only by the user. Sharing should be used on dedicated servers or cloud instances that are managing access controls. Some environments may encounter problems if execute rights are removed as well as read and write. Either no access or execute only for group or others is acceptable.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Related to SIP controls, Library Validation is a security feature introduced in macOS 10.10 Yosemite. Library Validation protects processes from loading arbitrary libraries. This stops root from loading arbitrary libraries into any process (depending on SIP status), and keeps root from becoming more powerful. Security is strengthened, because some user processes can no longer be fooled to run additional code without root's explicit request, which may grant access to daemons that depend on Library Validation for secure validation of code identity.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>With SIP enabled, Library Validation cannot be disabled. To test against a non-validated library, you will need to disabled SIP AND disable Library Validation.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Sealed System Volume is a security feature introduced in macOS 11.0 Big Sur.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>During system installation, a SHA-256 cryptographic hash is calculated for all immutable system files and stored in a Merkle tree which itself is hashed as the Seal. Both are stored in the metadata of the snapshot created of the System volume.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The seal is verified by the boot loader at startup. macOS will not boot if system files have been tampered with. If validation fails, the user will be instructed to reinstall the operating system.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Password security is an important part of general IT security where passwords are in use. For macOS, passwords are still much more widely used than other methods for account access. While there are other authentication and authorization methods for access from a macOS computer to organizational services, console access to the Mac is probably done using a password. This section contains password controls.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Apple has provided sufficient security controls to resist password attacks against the locked console, thus the CIS benchmark no longer recommends locking the keychain in addition to locking the console or display.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Recent updates based on research by NIST in SP800-63 call into question traditional password complexity and rotation requirements. Sticky notes are not a password management program, and password vault APIs are under increasing attack. Ideally, the user will remember their important passwords. The new understanding has informed changes to the previous password recommendations.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Length, threshold, and a yearly rotation requirement are the only scored controls below. Other controls will remain as unscored options. Passwords used for macOS are likely to also function as encryption keys for FileVault. Depending on the information confidentiality on FileVault volumes, stronger passwords may be required than are necessary to pass the controls in this Benchmark.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Apple-supported solutions for managing local passwords on macOS are to use either an XML file that contains password rules that are imported with pwpolicy or through the use of a profile. In either case, the controls in this section can be implemented with an organizationally-approved password policy.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
Before applying your organizations password policy, the existing password policy should be cleared so there is no out-dated or conflicting legacy settings in the password policy. A pre-existing password policly could result in false results. To clear the password policy before applying the newest options, use the command           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -clearaccountpolicies</xhtml:span>

 The current method of creating and setting password policy is using the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pwpolicy -setglobalpolicy</xhtml:span>
 command. That command has been deprecated by Apple, but is still in use in the current version of macOS. The Benchmark will continue to use this command line method for passwords until Apple removes it from the OS. Setting password policy with mobile configuration profiles is the preferred method going forward.        </xhtml:p>

 The CIS macOS community has decided to not require the additional password complexity settings (Recommendations               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">5.3</xhtml:span>
 -               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">5.6</xhtml:span>
). Because of that, we have left the complexity recommendations as a manual assessment. Since there are a large amount of admins in the greater macOS world that do need these settings, we include both the guidance for the proper setting as well as probes for CIS-CAT to test.            </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Over time, passwords can be captured by third parties through mistakes, phishing attacks, third-party breaches, or merely brute-force attacks. To reduce the risk of exposure and to decrease the incentives of password reuse (passwords that are not forced to be changed periodically generally are not ever changed), users must reset passwords periodically. This control ensures that previous passwords are not reused immediately by keeping a history of previous password hashes. Ensure that password history checks are part of the password policy on the computer. This control checks whether a new password is different than the previous 15.
The latest NIST guidance based on exploit research referenced in this section details how one of the greatest risks is password exposure rather than password cracking. Passwords should be changed to a new unique value whenever a password might have been exposed to anyone other than the account holder. Attackers have maintained persistent control based on predictable password change patterns and substantially different patterns should be used in case of a leak.</xhtml:p>

Apple developed a new file system which was first made available in 10.12 and then became the default in 10.13. The file system is optimized for Flash and Solid-State storage and encryption.

               <xhtml:p>EFI is the software link between the motherboard hardware and the software operating system. EFI determines which partition or disk to load macOS from, and it also determines whether the user can enter single user mode. The main reasons to set a firmware password have been protections against an alternative boot disk, protection against a passwordless root shell through single user mode, and protection against firewire DMA attacks. While it was easier in the past to reset the firmware password by removing RAM, it did make tampering slightly harder because having to remove RAM remediated memory scraping attacks through DMA. It has always been difficult to manage the firmware password on macOS computers, though some tools did make it much easier.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The EFI password management capability has been replaced in new Apple silicon Macs. The security features are replaced in the Silicon Mac recoveryOS. Long-term it appears that macOS EFI management is a deprecated technology in mixed Intel/Apple Silicon environments.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Apple patched OS X in 10.7 to mitigate the DMA attacks, and the use of FileVault 2 Full-Disk Encryption mitigates the risk of damage to the boot volume if an unauthorized user uses a different boot volume or uses single user mode. Apple's reliance on the recovery partition and the additional features it provides make controls that do not allow the user to boot into the recovery partition less attractive.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Starting in late 2010 with the MacBook Air, Apple has slowly updated the requirements to recover from a lost firmware password. Apple only supports taking the computer to an Apple authorized service provider. This change makes managing the firmware password effectively more critical if it is used.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Setting the firmware password may be a good practice in some environments. We cannot recommend it as a standard security practice at this time.</xhtml:p>

There is no need for the legacy Guest home folder to remain in the file system. When normal user accounts are removed, you have the option to archive it, leave it in place, or delete. In the case of the guest folder, the folder remains in place without a GUI option to remove it. If at some point in the future a Guest account is needed, it will be re-created. The presence of the Guest home folder can cause automated audits to fail when looking for compliant settings within all User folders, as well.

Any email client should be hardened with controls that assist the user against social engineering attacks to reduce the risk of unwanted emails.
