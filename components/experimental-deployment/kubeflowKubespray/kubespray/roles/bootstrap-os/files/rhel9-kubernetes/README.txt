The CIS Linux Build Kit (CIS-LBK) is a GZIP Compressed Tar Archive file containing the file structure and files
necessary to remediate the target system into alignment with a specific CIS Linux Benchmark.

Exclusion List:
	The CIS-LBK include a file called "exclusion_list.txt".  This file allows for recommendations to be excluded
	from the LBK's remediation.
	
	To use this file, add the number of the recommendation you would like excluded.  Each recommendation's number
	should be added to its own line in this file
	
Output Log Files:
	The CIS-LBK will output a number of log files. These files are stored in the 'logs' directory
	
	CIS-LBK.log - The standard log file containing final status of each Build Kit item.
	CIS-LBK_error.log - This file captures errors generated by the main script.
	CIS-LBK_failed.log - This file captures the list of Build Kit items that failed remediation.
	CIS-LBK_manual.log - This file captures the Build Kit items that cannot be automatically remediated. The items
	                     in this log will require manual remediation.
	CIS-LBK_verbose.log - This file captures the verbose output of each Build Kit item's execution.

	101 - Passed - No remediation required
	102 - Failed - Manual Remediation may be required
	103 - Remediated - Build Kit successfully remediated the recommendation
	104 - Not Applicable - Recommendation has been determined to be non applicable
