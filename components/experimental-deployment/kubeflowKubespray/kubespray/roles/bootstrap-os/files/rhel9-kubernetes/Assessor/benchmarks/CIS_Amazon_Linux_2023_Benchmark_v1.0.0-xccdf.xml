      <xhtml:p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Amazon Linux 2023 running on x86_64 platforms.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user, and executed under the default Bash version for the applicable distribution. Operations performed using       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
 instead of the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user, or executed under another shell, may produce unexpected results, or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.    </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
The default prompt for the       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>
 user is       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">#</xhtml:span>
, and as such all sample commands will have       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">#</xhtml:span>
 as an additional indication that it is to be executed as       <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root</xhtml:span>

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

            <xhtml:p>Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
Mount the new partition to a temporary mountpoint e.g.             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/sda2 /mnt</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Copy data from the original partition to the new partition. e.g.             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">cp /var/tmp/* /mnt</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Verify that all data is present on the new partition. e.g.             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ls -la /mnt</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Unmount the new partition. e.g.             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umount /mnt</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Remove the data from the original directory that was in the old partition. e.g.             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rm -Rf /var/tmp/*</xhtml:span>
 Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Mount the new partition to the desired mountpoint. e.g.             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount /dev/sda2 /var/tmp</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Update             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/fstab</xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:p>A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:strong>Note</xhtml:strong>
: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

Kernel modules loaded directly via             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">insmod</xhtml:span>

By using             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/bin/false</xhtml:span>
 as the command in disabling a particular module serves two purposes; to convey the meaning of the entry to the user and cause a non-zero return value. The latter can be tested for in scripts. Please note that             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">insmod</xhtml:span>
 will ignore what is configured in the relevant             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf</xhtml:span>

 application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment.                  </xhtml:p>

Making               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec</xhtml:span>

                           <xhtml:p>
By design files saved to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system.                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 is ram based and all files stored to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 will be lost when the system is rebooted.                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 not                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
.                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
Since the                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 or a separate partition. Running out of                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 (as with                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 which is RAM-based.                  </xhtml:p>

When modifying                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.              </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection from resource exhaustion</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man auditd.conf</xhtml:span>
 for details.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Fine grained control over the mount</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
Configuring               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection from exploitation</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
An example of exploiting               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var</xhtml:span>
 may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">setuid</xhtml:span>
 program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.            </xhtml:p>

When modifying                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.              </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection from resource exhaustion</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 and cause potential disruption to daemons as the disk is full.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Fine grained control over the mount</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
Configuring               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection from exploitation</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
An example of exploiting               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">setuid</xhtml:span>
 program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.            </xhtml:p>

When modifying                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multiuser mode.              </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection from resource exhaustion</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 directory contains log files which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Fine grained control over the mount</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
Configuring               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection of log data</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
As               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log</xhtml:span>
 contains log files, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point.            </xhtml:p>

When modifying                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.              </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection from resource exhaustion</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 directory contains the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">audit.log</xhtml:span>
 file which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 and cause               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
 to trigger it's               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">space_left_action</xhtml:span>
 as the disk is full. See               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man auditd.conf</xhtml:span>
 for details.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Fine grained control over the mount</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
Configuring               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection of audit data</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
As               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit</xhtml:span>
 contains audit logs, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point.            </xhtml:p>

When modifying                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the data over before returning to multi-user mode.              </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>
The reasoning for mounting               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 on a separate partition is as follows.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection from resource exhaustion</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
The default installation only creates a single               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. Since the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 directory contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 and impact all local users.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Fine grained control over the mount</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
Configuring               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">noexec/nosuid/nodev</xhtml:span>
. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. In the case of               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 options such as               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">usrquota/grpquota</xhtml:span>
 may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man mount</xhtml:span>
 for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.            </xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:h4>Protection of user data</xhtml:h4>
                  <xhtml:p>
As               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/home</xhtml:span>
 contains user data, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point.            </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Fedora 34/CentOS 9 stream derived Linux distributions use dnf (previously yum) to install and update software packages. Patch management procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises may choose to install a local updates server that can be used in place of their distributions servers, whereas a single deployment of a system may prefer to get updates directly. Updates can be performed automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for patch management. Organizations may prefer to test patches against their environment on a non-production system before rolling out to production.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Outdated software is vulnerable to cyber criminals and hackers. Software updates help reduce the risk to your organization. The release of software update notes often reveal the patched exploitable entry points to the public. Public knowledge of these exploits cans your organization more vulnerable to malicious actors attempting to gain entry to your system's data.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Software updates often offer new and improved features and speed enhancements</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>For the purpose of this benchmark, the requirement is to ensure that a patch management process is defined and maintained, the specifics of which are left to the organization.</xhtml:p>

In Fedora 28 based distributions, the kernel command-line parameters for systems using the GRUB2 bootloader were defined in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">kernelopts</xhtml:span>
 environment variable. This variable was stored in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/grub2/grubenv</xhtml:span>
 file for each kernel boot entry. However, storing the kernel command-line parameters using             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">kernelopts</xhtml:span>
 was not robust. Therefore, the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">kernelopts</xhtml:span>
 has been removed and the kernel command-line parameters are now stored in the Boot Loader Specification (BLS) snippet, instead of in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/loader/entries/&lt;KERNEL_BOOT_ENTRY&gt;.conf</xhtml:span>
 file.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Boot loader configuration files are unified across CPU architectures
            <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>
Configuration files for the GRUB boot loader are now stored in the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/grub2/</xhtml:span>
 directory on all supported CPU architectures. The                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg</xhtml:span>
 file, which GRUB previously used as the main configuration file on UEFI systems, now simply loads the                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</xhtml:span>
 file.              </xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>
This change simplifies the layout of the GRUB configuration file, improves user experience, and provides the following notable benefits:
                <xhtml:ul>
                           <xhtml:li>You can boot the same installation with either EFI or legacy BIOS.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>You can use the same documentation and commands for all architectures.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>GRUB configuration tools are more robust, because they no longer rely on symbolic links and they do not have to handle platform-specific cases.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>The usage of the GRUB configuration files is aligned with images generated by CoreOS Assembler (COSA) and OSBuild.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>The usage of the GRUB configuration files is aligned with other Linux distributions.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>Fedora 34 based distributions no longer boot on 32-bit UEFI</xhtml:li>

                     </xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
               </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Support for the 32-bit UEFI firmware was removed from the GRUB and shim boot loaders. As a consequence, Fedora 34 based distributions requires a 64-bit UEFI, and can no longer boot on 64-bit systems that use a 32-bit UEFI.

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the processes can be reduced.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Impact:</xhtml:strong>
 Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.        </xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:Group id="xccdf_org.cisecurity.benchmarks_group_1.6.1_Configure_SELinux">
            <xccdf:title xml:lang="en">Configure SELinux</xccdf:title>
            <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
               <xhtml:p>SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Every process and system resource has a special security label called an SELinux context. A SELinux context, sometimes referred to as an SELinux label, is an identifier which abstracts away the system-level details and focuses on the security properties of the entity. Not only does this provide a consistent way of referencing objects in the SELinux policy, but it also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods. For example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>In Fedora 34 Family Linux distributions, system services are controlled by the systemd daemon; systemd starts and stops all services, and users and processes communicate with systemd using the systemctl utility.  The systemd daemon can consult the SELinux policy and check the label of the calling process and the label of the unit file that the caller tries to manage, and then ask SELinux whether or not the caller is allowed the access. This approach strengthens access control to critical system capabilities, which include starting and stopping system services.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Two such policies have been designed for use with Fedora 34 Family Linux distributions and are included with the system:             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">targeted</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mls</xhtml:span>
. These are described as follows:          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">targeted</xhtml:span>
: targeted processes run in their own domain, called a confined domain. In a confined domain, the files that a targeted process has access to are limited. If a confined process is compromised by an attacker, the attacker’s access to resources and the possible damage they can do is also limited. SELinux denies access to these resources and logs the denial.            </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mls</xhtml:span>
: implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these.            </xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:p>
This section provides guidance for the configuration of the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">targeted</xhtml:span>
 policy.          </xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:strong>Notes:</xhtml:strong>
               </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules. SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which means that no SELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules prevent the access.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>To avoid incorrect SELinux labeling and subsequent problems, ensure that you start services using a systemctl start command.</xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:p>SELinux can run in one of three modes: disabled, permissive, or enforcing:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>Enforcing - Is the default, and recommended, mode of operation; in enforcing mode SELinux operates normally, enforcing the loaded security policy on the entire system.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>Permissive - The system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy, including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs, but it does not actually deny any operations. While not recommended for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy development.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>Disabled - Is strongly discouraged; not only does the system avoid enforcing the SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future</xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:em>Note: you can set individual domains to permissive mode while the system runs in enforcing mode. For example, to make the httpd_t domain permissive:</xhtml:em>

            <xhtml:p>Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.

            <xhtml:p>
Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.

The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of possible threats to the resulting system.

               <xhtml:p>The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening.</xhtml:p>

 forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the packet was valid.

 is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols (bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your system, you will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing.          </xhtml:p>

SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.          </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>A Host Based Firewall, on a Linux system, is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through</xhtml:p>

            </xhtml:ul>

Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added support for acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program. firewalld supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles.</xhtml:li>

                  <xhtml:strong>NOTE:</xhtml:strong>
 To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not, and never had, intentionally the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 and thus may no longer be abused to disconnect idle users.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
The two options             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 5 sshd_config</xhtml:span>
:          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.              </xhtml:p>
                  </xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.  It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.              </xhtml:p>

In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
. Specifically, looking at the source code,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate.</xhtml:p>

The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism. If authentication is required,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span>
 will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific.          </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Authselect is a utility that simplifies the configuration of user authentication. Authselect offers two ready-made profiles that can be universally used with all modern identity management systems</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Authselect makes testing and troubleshooting easy because it only modifies files in these directories:</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>You can create and deploy a custom profile by customizing one of the default profiles, the sssd, winbind, or the nis profile. This is particularly useful if Modifying a ready-made authselect profile is not enough for your needs. When you deploy a custom profile, the profile is applied to every user logging into the given host.  This would be the recommended method, so that the existing profiles can remain unmodified.</xhtml:p>

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular authentication modules on UNIX systems. PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects that are loaded and executed when a program needs to authenticate a user. Files for PAM are typically located in the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pam.d</xhtml:span>
 directory. PAM must be carefully configured to secure system authentication. While this section covers some of PAM, please consult other PAM resources to fully understand the configuration capabilities.        </xhtml:p>

The user file-creation mode mask (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rwxrwxrwx</xhtml:span>
), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rw-rw-rw-</xhtml:span>
). The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

 or               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.            </xhtml:li>

                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Symbolic</xhtml:span>

. ie a               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  This               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 would set a newly created directory with file mode               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">drwxr-x---</xhtml:span>

      <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
         <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
It is recommended that         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog </xhtml:span>
be used for logging (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logwatch </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) and         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
 be used for auditing (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aureport </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference &lt;        <xhtml:a href="http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/">http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/</xhtml:a>
&gt; manual page for more information on configuring chrony.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:strong>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:strong>
 There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>
). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640 </xhtml:span>
where         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp</xhtml:span>
 is the defined security group (in some cases         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>
).      </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Logging services should be configured to prevent information leaks and to aggregate logs on a remote server so that they can be reviewed in the event of a system compromise.

            <xhtml:h3>Security principals for logging</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Ensure transport layer security is implemented between the client and the log server.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Ensure that logs are rotated as per the environment requirements.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Ensure all locally generated logs have the appropriate permissions.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Ensure all security logs are sent to a remote log server.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Ensure the required events are logged.</xhtml:li>

            <xhtml:h3>What is covered</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:p>
This section will cover the minimum best practices for the usage of           <xhtml:strong>either</xhtml:strong>
               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
               <xhtml:strong>or</xhtml:strong>
               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
. The recommendations are written such that each is wholly independent of each other and           <xhtml:strong>only one is implemented</xhtml:strong>
.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
If your organization makes use of an enterprise wide logging system completely outside of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 or             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
, then the following recommendations do not directly apply. However, the principals of the recommendations should be followed regardless of what solution is implemented. If the enterprise solution incorporates either of these tools, careful consideration should be given to the following recommendations to determine exactly what applies.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Should your organization make use of both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
, take care how the recommendations may or may not apply to you.          </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:h3>What is not covered</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
Enterprise logging systems not utilizing             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 or             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
.
As logging is very situational and dependent on the local environment, not everything can be covered here.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Transport layer security should be applied to all remote logging functionality. Both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
 supports secure transport and should be configured as such.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>The log server. There are a multitude of reasons for a centralized log server (and keeping a short period of logging on the local system), but the log server is out of scope for these recommendations.</xhtml:li>

As noted in the journald man pages, journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">systemd-journald.service</xhtml:span>

 will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities.  Mechanisms such as                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">systemd-journald.service</xhtml:span>
, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export.  Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.              </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>
The Linux Auditing System operates on a set of rules that collects certain types of system activity to facilitate incident investigation, detect unauthorized access or modification of data.  By default events will be logged to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit/audit.log</xhtml:span>
, which can be configured in           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/auditd.conf</xhtml:span>
.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The following types of audit rules can be specified:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Control rules: Configuration of the auditing system.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>File system rules: Allow the auditing of access to a particular file or a directory. Also known as file watches.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>System call rules: Allow logging of system calls that any specified program makes.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>Audit rules can be set:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
On the command line using the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditctl</xhtml:span>
 utility. These rules are not persistent across reboots.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
In             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/audit.rules</xhtml:span>
. These rules have to be merged and loaded before they are active.          </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:strong>Notes:</xhtml:strong>
            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
For 64 bit systems that have             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">arch</xhtml:span>
 as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems calls. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
If the auditing system is configured to be locked (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-e 2</xhtml:span>
), a system reboot will be required in order to load any changes.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Key names are optional on the rules and will not be used in compliance auditing. The usage of key names is highly recommended as it facilitates organization and searching; as such, all remediation steps will have key names supplied.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
It is best practice to store the rules, in number prepended files, in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/rules.d/</xhtml:span>
. Rules must end in a             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">.rules</xhtml:span>
 suffix. This then requires the use of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">augenrules</xhtml:span>
 to merge all the rules into             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/audit.rules</xhtml:span>
 based on their alphabetical (lexical) sort order. All benchmark recommendations follow this best practice for remediation, specifically using the prefix of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">50</xhtml:span>
 which is center weighed if all rule sets make use of the number prepending naming convention.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Your system may have been customized to change the default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UID_MIN</xhtml:span>
. All sample output uses             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">1000</xhtml:span>
, but this value will not be used in compliance auditing. To confirm the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UID_MIN</xhtml:span>
 for your system, run the following command:             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs</xhtml:span>
               </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:h4>Normalization</xhtml:h4>
            <xhtml:p>The Audit system normalizes some entries, so when you look at the sample output keep in mind that:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
With regards to users whose login UID is not set, the values             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-1</xhtml:span>
 /             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">unset</xhtml:span>
 /             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">4294967295</xhtml:span>
 are equivalent and normalized to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-1</xhtml:span>
.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
When comparing field types and both sides of the comparison is valid fields types, such as             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">euid!=uid</xhtml:span>
, then the auditing system may normalize such that the output is             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">uid!=euid</xhtml:span>
.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Some parts of the rule may be rearranged whilst others are dependent on previous syntax. For example, the following two statements are the same:</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:code class="code_block">-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F auid!=-1 -F key=user_emulation
</xhtml:code>
            <xhtml:p>and</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:code class="code_block">-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k user_emulation
</xhtml:code>
            <xhtml:h4>Capacity planning</xhtml:h4>
            <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section implement auditing policies that not only produce large quantities of logged data, but may also negatively impact system performance. Capacity planning is critical in order not to adversely impact production environments.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Disk space. If a significantly large set of events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. If the logs are not sent to a remote log server, ensure that log rotation is implemented else the disk will fill up and the system will halt. Even when logs are sent to a log server, ensure sufficient disk space to allow caching of logs in the case of temporary network outages.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Disk IO. It is not just the amount of data collected that should be considered, but the rate at which logs are generated.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>CPU overhead. System call rules might incur considerable CPU overhead. Test the systems open/close syscalls per second with and without the rules to gauge the impact of the rules.</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>

By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.</xhtml:p>

If the auditing configuration is locked (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-e 2</xhtml:span>
), then                 <xhtml:span class="inline_block">augenrules</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:h4>System call structure</xhtml:h4>
                     <xhtml:p>
For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 file systems to the system. While tracking               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">open</xhtml:span>
,               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">creat</xhtml:span>
 and               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">truncate</xhtml:span>
 system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.            </xhtml:p>

For performance (                <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 7 audit.rules</xhtml:span>
) reasons it is preferable to have all the system calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.              </xhtml:p>

The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>

 file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/passwd</xhtml:span>
