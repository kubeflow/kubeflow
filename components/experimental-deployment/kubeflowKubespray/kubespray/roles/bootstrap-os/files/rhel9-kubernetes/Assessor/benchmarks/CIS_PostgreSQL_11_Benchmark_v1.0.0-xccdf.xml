   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

Status information may be aligned either left or right by specifying a numeric literal after the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">%</xhtml:span> and before the option. A negative value will cause the status information to be padded on the right with spaces to give it a minimum width, whereas a positive value will pad on the left.

It is not enough to have a list of all the operations performed against the database, it must also be possible to find particular statements that are of interest to an auditor. The standard logging facility shows what the user requested, while pgAudit focuses on the details of what happened while the database was satisfying the request.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>When logging <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SELECT</xhtml:span> and <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DML</xhtml:span> statements, pgAudit can be configured to log a separate entry for each relation referenced in a statement. No parsing is required to find all statements that touch a particular table. In fact, the goal is that the statement text is provided primarily for deep forensics and should not be required for an audit.</xhtml:p>

pgAudit is now installed and ready to be configured. Next, we need to alter the `postgresql.conf` configuration file to:
* enable pgAudit as an extension in the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter
* indicate which classes of statements we want to log via the `pgaudit.log` parameter

and, finally, restart the PostgreSQL service:
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>$ vi ${PGDATA}/postgresql.conf
Find the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">shared_preload_libraries</xhtml:span> entry, and add 'pgaudit' to it (preserving any existing entries):</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">shared_preload_libraries = 'pgaudit'<br/>
                     <br/>OR<br/>
                     <br/>shared_preload_libraries = 'pgaudit,somethingelse'<br/>
Now, add a new `pgaudit`-specific entry:
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:h1>for this example we are logging the ddl and write operationspgaudit.log='ddl,write'</xhtml:h1>
                  <xhtml:p>Restart the PostgreSQL server for changes to take affect:</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Where possible, revoke <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SECURITY DEFINER</xhtml:span> on PostgreSQL functions. To change a <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SECURITY DEFINER</xhtml:span> function to <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SECURITY INVOKER</xhtml:span>, run the following SQL:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">$ whoami<br/>root<br/>$ sudo su - postgres<br/>$ psql -c "ALTER FUNCTION [functionname] SECURITY INVOKER;"<br/>
If it is not possible to revoke `SECURITY DEFINER`, ensure the function can be executed by only the accounts that absolutely need such functionality:

Based on output above, `appreader=X/postgres` no longer exists in the `proacl` column results returned from query and confirms `appreader` is no longer granted execute privilege on the function.

Now you need to add entries to `permission_target` that correspond to your _desired permissions_.

Let's assume we have a schema `appschema`, and `appuser` should have `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT` permissions on all tables and views in that schema:

</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>postgres=# INSERT INTO public.permission_targetpostgres=#   (id, role_name, permissions,postgres=#    object_type, schema_name)postgres=# VALUESpostgres=#   (1, 'appuser', '{SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE}',postgres=#    'TABLE', 'appschema');INSERT 0 1postgres=# INSERT INTO public.permission_targetpostgres=#   (id, role_name, permissions,postgres=#    object_type, schema_name)postgres=# VALUESpostgres=#   (2, 'appuser', '{SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE}',postgres=#    'VIEW', 'appschema');INSERT 0 1</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Of course, the user will need the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">USAGE</xhtml:span> privilege on the schema:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">postgres=# INSERT INTO public.permission_target<br/>postgres=#   (id, role_name, permissions,i<br/>postgres=#    object_type, schema_name)<br/>postgres=# VALUES<br/>postgres=#   (3, 'appuser', '{USAGE}',<br/>postgres=#    'SCHEMA', 'appschema');<br/>INSERT 0 1<br/>

The user also needs `USAGE` privileges on the `appseq` sequence in that schema:

</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>postgres=# INSERT INTO public.permission_targetpostgres=#   (id, role_name, permissions,postgres=#    object_type, schema_name, object_name)postgres=# VALUESpostgres=#   (4, 'appuser', '{USAGE}',postgres=#    'SEQUENCE', 'appschema', 'appseq');INSERT 0 1</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Now we can review which permissions are missing and which additional permissions are granted:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">postgres=# SELECT * FROM public.permission_diffs();<br/>
                     <br/> missing | role_name | object_type | schema_name | object_name | column_name | permission<br/>---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------<br/> f       | laurenz   | VIEW        | appschema   | appview     |             | SELECT<br/> t       | appuser   | TABLE       | appschema   | apptable    |             | DELETE<br/>(2 rows)<br/>

That means that `appuser` is missing (missing is TRUE) the DELETE privilege on `appschema.apptable` which should be `GRANT`ed, while user `laurenz` has the **additional** `SELECT` privilege on `appschema.appview` (missing is FALSE).

To review the actual permissions on an object, we can use the `_permissions` views:

</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>postgres=# SELECT * FROM schema_permissionspostgres=#   WHERE role_name = 'appuser' AND schema_name = 'appschema' AND granted IS TRUE; object_type | role_name | schema_name | object_name | column_name | permissions | granted-------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+--------- SCHEMA      | appuser   | appschema   |             |             | USAGE       | t (1 row)</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>In addition to the SQL-standard privilege system available through <xhtml:span class="inline_block">GRANT</xhtml:span>, tables can have row security policies that restrict, on a per-user basis, which individual rows can be returned by normal queries or inserted, updated, or deleted by data modification commands. This feature is also known as Row Level Security (RLS).</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>By default, tables do not have any policies, so if a user has access privileges to a table according to the SQL privilege system, all rows within it are equally available for querying or updating. Row security policies can be specific to commands, to roles, or to both. A policy can be specified to apply to <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ALL</xhtml:span> commands, or to any combination of <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SELECT</xhtml:span>, <xhtml:span class="inline_block">INSERT</xhtml:span>, <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UPDATE</xhtml:span>, or <xhtml:span class="inline_block">DELETE</xhtml:span>. Multiple roles can be assigned to a given policy, and normal role membership and inheritance rules apply.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>If you use RLS and apply restrictive policies to certain users, it is important that the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Bypass RLS</xhtml:span> privilege not be granted to any unauthorized users. This privilege overrides RLS-enabled tables and associated policies. Generally, only superusers and elevated users should possess this privilege.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>Again, we are using the example from the PostgreSQL documentation using the example <xhtml:span class="inline_block">passwd</xhtml:span> table. We will create three database roles to illustrate the workings of RLS:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">postgres=# CREATE ROLE admin;<br/>CREATE ROLE<br/>postgres=# CREATE ROLE bob;<br/>CREATE ROLE<br/>postgres=# CREATE ROLE alice;<br/>CREATE ROLE<br/>
Now, we will insert known data into the `passwd` table:
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>postgres=# INSERT INTO passwd VALUES  ('admin','xxx',0,0,'Admin','111-222-3333',null,'/root','/bin/dash');INSERT 0 1postgres=# INSERT INTO passwd VALUES  ('bob','xxx',1,1,'Bob','123-456-7890',null,'/home/bob','/bin/zsh');INSERT 0 1postgres=# INSERT INTO passwd VALUES  ('alice','xxx',2,1,'Alice','098-765-4321',null,'/home/alice','/bin/zsh');INSERT 0 1
And we will enable RLS on the table:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">postgres=# ALTER TABLE passwd ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;<br/>ALTER TABLE<br/>
Now that RLS is enabled, we need to define one or more policies. Create the administrator policy and allow it access to all rows:
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>postgres=# CREATE POLICY admin_all ON passwd TO admin USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);CREATE POLICY
Create a policy for normal users to <xhtml:em>view</xhtml:em> all rows:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">postgres=# CREATE POLICY all_view ON passwd FOR SELECT USING (true);<br/>CREATE POLICY<br/>
Create a policy for normal users that allows them to update only their own rows and to limit what values can be set for their login shell:
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>postgres=# CREATE POLICY user_mod ON passwd FOR UPDATE  USING (current_user = user_name)  WITH CHECK (    current_user = user_name AND    shell IN ('/bin/bash','/bin/sh','/bin/dash','/bin/zsh','/bin/tcsh')  );CREATE POLICY
Grant all the normal rights on the table to the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">admin</xhtml:span> user:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">postgres=# GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON passwd TO admin;<br/>GRANT<br/>
Grant only select access on non-sensitive columns to everyone:
</xhtml:code>

Ensure that no one has been granted `Bypass RLS` inadvertently, by running the `psql` display command `\du+`. If unauthorized users do have `Bypass RLS` granted then resolve this using the `ALTER ROLE &lt;user&gt; NOBYPASSRLS;` command.

You can now verify that 'admin', 'bob', and 'alice' are properly restricted by querying the `passwd` table as each of these roles.

            <xhtml:p>Even when reducing and limiting the access to the superuser role as described earlier in this benchmark, it is still difficult to determine who accessed the superuser role and what actions were taken using that role. As such, it is ideal to prevent anyone from logging in as the superuser and forcing them to escalate their role. This model is used at the OS level by the use of <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sudo</xhtml:span> and should be emulated in the database. The <xhtml:span class="inline_block">set_user</xhtml:span> extension allows for this setup.</xhtml:p>

Now that `set_user` is installed, we need to tell PostgreSQL to load its library:
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>$ whoamiroot$ vi ~postgres/11/data/postgresql.conf# load set_user libs before anything elseshared_preload_libraries = 'set_user, other_libs'[root@centos7 ~]# systemctl restart postgresql-11[root@centos7 ~]# systemctl status postgresql-11|grep 'ago$'   Active: active (running) since Thu 2019-05-30 15:13:02 EDT; 1s ago
And now, we can install the extension with SQL:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">postgres=# select * from pg_available_extensions where name = 'set_user';<br/>  name   | default_version | installed_version |                  comment<br/>---------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------------------------<br/>set_user | 1.6             |                   | similar to SET ROLE but with<br/>         |                 |                   | added logging<br/>(1 row)<br/>
                     <br/>postgres=# create extension set_user;<br/>CREATE EXTENSION<br/>postgres=# select * from pg_available_extensions where name = 'set_user';<br/>  name   | default_version | installed_version |                  comment<br/>---------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------------------------<br/>set_user | 1.6             | 1.6               | similar to SET ROLE but with<br/>         |                 |                   | added logging<br/>
                     <br/>(1 row)<br/>
Now, we use `GRANT` to configure each DBA role to allow it to use the `set_user` functions. In the example below, we will configure my db user `doug`. (You would do this for each DBA's normal user role.)
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>postgres=# grant execute on function set_user(text) to doug;GRANTpostgres=# grant execute on function set_user_u(text) to doug;GRANT
Connect to PostgreSQL as yourself and verify it works as expected:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">$ whoami<br/>psql<br/>$ psql -U doug -d postgres<br/>postgres=&gt; select set_user('postgres');<br/>ERROR:  switching to superuser not allowed<br/>HINT:  Use 'set_user_u' to escalate.<br/>postgres=&gt; select set_user_u('postgres');<br/> set_user_u<br/>------------<br/> OK<br/>(1 row)<br/>
                     <br/>postgres=# select current_user, session_user;<br/> current_user | session_user<br/>--------------+--------------<br/> postgres     | doug<br/>(1 row)<br/>
                     <br/>postgres=# select reset_user();<br/> reset_user<br/>------------<br/> OK<br/>(1 row)<br/>
                     <br/>postgres=&gt; select current_user, session_user;<br/> current_user | session_user<br/>--------------+--------------<br/> doug         | doug<br/>(1 row)<br/>
Once all DBA's normal user accounts have been `GRANT`ed permission, revoke the ability to login as the `postgres` (superuser) user:
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>postgres=# alter user postgres NOLOGIN;ALTER ROLE
Which results in:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:code class="code_block">$ psql<br/>psql: FATAL:  role "postgres" is not permitted to log in<br/>$ psql -U doug -d postgres<br/>psql (11.3)<br/>
Make sure there are no other roles that are superuser's and can still login:
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:p>postgres=# SELECT rolname FROM pg_authid WHERE rolsuper and rolcanlogin; rolname---------(0 rows)
Verify there are no unprivileged roles that can login directly that are granted a superuser role even if it is multiple layers removed:</xhtml:p>

         <xhtml:p>The restrictions on client/user connections to the PostgreSQL database blocks unauthorized access to data and services by setting access rules. These security measures help to ensure that successful logins cannot be easily made through brute-force password attacks, pass the hash, or intuited by clever social engineering exploits.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>Settings are generally recommended to be applied to all defined profiles. The following presents standalone examples of logins for particular use cases. The authentication rules are read from the PostgreSQL host-based authentication file, <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pg_hba.conf</xhtml:span>, from top to bottom. The first rule conforming to the condition of the request executes the METHOD <xhtml:em>and stops further processing of the file</xhtml:em>. Incorrectly applied rules, as defined by a single line instruction, can substantially alter the intended behavior resulting in either allowing or denying login attempts.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>It is strongly recommended that authentication configurations be constructed incrementally with rigid testing for each newly applied rule. Because of the large number of different variations, this benchmark limits itself to a small number of authentication methods that can be successfully applied under most circumstances. Further analysis, using the other authentication methods available in PostgreSQL, is encouraged.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:code class="code_block"># TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD<br/>local   all             postgres                                peer<br/>
More traditionally, a rule like the following would be used to allow any local PEER connection:
</xhtml:code>
                  <xhtml:h1>TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHODlocal   all             all                                     peer</xhtml:h1>
                  <xhtml:p>Once edited, the server process must reload the authentication file before it can take effect. Improperly configured rules cannot update i.e. the old rules remain in place. The PostgreSQL logs will report the outcome of the SIGHUP:</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>PostgreSQL handling data that requires "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest. These cryptographic mechanisms may be native to PostgreSQL or implemented via additional software or operating system/file system settings, as appropriate to the situation. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g. disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e. full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g. files, records, or fields). Organizations may also optionally choose to implement both to implement layered security.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The decision whether, and what, to encrypt rests with the data owner and is also influenced by the physical measures taken to secure the equipment and media on which the information resides. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate. If the confidentiality and integrity of application data is not protected, the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The PostgreSQL <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pgcrypto</xhtml:span> extension provides cryptographic functions for PostgreSQL and is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of user and system information at rest in non-mobile devices.</xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
         <xhtml:p>Data redundancy often plays a major role as part of an overall database strategy. Replication is an example of data redundancy and fulfills both High Availability and High Performance requirements. However, although the DBA may have expended much time and effort securing the PRIMARY host and taken the time to harden STANDBY configuration parameters, one sometimes overlooks the medium transmitting the data itself over the network. Consequently, replication is an appealing attack vector given that all DDL, and DML operations executed on the PRIMARY, or master, host is sent over the wire to the SECONDARY/STANDBY, or slave, hosts. Fortunately, when correctly understood, defeating such attacks can be implemented in a straight forward manner. This benchmark reviews those issues surrounding the most common mechanisms of replicating data between hosts. There are several PostgreSQL replication mechanisms and includes:</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>Warm Standby (also known as LOG Shipping)
<xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Transaction logs are copied from the PRIMARY to SECONDARY host that reads the logs in a "recovery" mode. For all intents and purposes the host ingesting the WAL cannot be read i.e. it's off-line.</xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
            </xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Hot Standby
<xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Operates in the exact same fashion as the Warm Standby Server except that, in addition, it offers a read-only environment for client connections to connect and query.</xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
            </xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Point In Time Recovery (PITR)
<xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Primarily used for database forensics and recovery at particular points in time such as in the case that important data may have been accidentally removed. One can restore the cluster to a point in time before the event occurred.</xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
            </xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Streaming Replication
<xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Uses an explicit connection, which in a manner of speaking is similar to the standard client connection, between the PRIMARY and STANDBY host. It too reads the transaction logs and ingests into a read-only server. What's different is that the connection uses a special replication protocol which is faster and more efficient than log shipping. Similar to standard client connections, it also honors the same authentication rules as expressed in the PostgreSQL host-based authentication file, <xhtml:span class="inline_block">pg_hba.conf</xhtml:span>.</xhtml:li>

Once installed, `pgBackRest` must be configured for things like stanza name, backup location, retention policy, logging, etc. Please consult the [configuration guide](http://pgbackrest.org/configuration.html).

If employing `pgBackRest` for your backup/recovery solution, ensure the repository, base backups, and WAL archives are stored on a reliable file system separate from the database server. Further, the external storage system where backups resided should have limited access to only those system administrators as necessary. Finally, as with any backup/recovery solution, stringent testing must be conducted. **A backup is only good if it can be restored successfully.**

            <xhtml:p>This recommendation covers non-regular, special files, and dynamic libraries.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>PostgreSQL permits local logins via the UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET and, for the most part, anyone with a legitimate Unix login account can make the attempt. Limiting PostgreSQL login attempts can be made by relocating the UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET to a subdirectory with restricted permissions.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The creation and implementation of user-defined dynamic libraries is an extraordinary powerful capability. In the hands of an experienced DBA/programmer, it can significantly enhance the power and flexibility of the RDBMS. But new and unexpected behavior can also be assigned to the RDBMS, resulting in a very dangerous environment in what should otherwise be trusted.</xhtml:p>
