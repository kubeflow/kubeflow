#
# This is the "master security properties file".
#
# An alternate java.security properties file may be specified
# from the command line via the system property
#
#    -Djava.security.properties=<URL>
#
# This properties file appends to the master security properties file.
# If both properties files specify values for the same key, the value
# from the command-line properties file is selected, as it is the last
# one loaded.
#
# Also, if you specify
#
#    -Djava.security.properties==<URL> (2 equals),
#
# then that properties file completely overrides the master security
# properties file.
#
# To disable the ability to specify an additional properties file from
# the command line, set the key security.overridePropertiesFile
# to false in the master security properties file. It is set to true
# by default.

# In this file, various security properties are set for use by
# java.security classes. This is where users can statically register
# Cryptography Package Providers ("providers" for short). The term
# "provider" refers to a package or set of packages that supply a
# concrete implementation of a subset of the cryptography aspects of
# the Java Security API. A provider may, for example, implement one or
# more digital signature algorithms or message digest algorithms.
#
# Each provider must implement a subclass of the Provider class.
# To register a provider in this master security properties file,
# specify the Provider subclass name and priority in the format
#
#    security.provider.<n>=<className>
#
# This declares a provider, and specifies its preference
# order n. The preference order is the order in which providers are
# searched for requested algorithms (when no specific provider is
# requested). The order is 1-based; 1 is the most preferred, followed
# by 2, and so on.
#
# <className> must specify the subclass of the Provider class whose
# constructor sets the values of various properties that are required
# for the Java Security API to look up the algorithms or other
# facilities implemented by the provider.
#
# There must be at least one provider specification in java.security.
# There is a default provider that comes standard with the JDK. It
# is called the "SUN" provider, and its Provider subclass
# named Sun appears in the sun.security.provider package. Thus, the
# "SUN" provider is registered via the following:
#
#    security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
#
# (The number 1 is used for the default provider.)
#
# Note: Providers can be dynamically registered instead by calls to
# either the addProvider or insertProviderAt method in the Security
# class.

#
# List of providers and their preference orders (see above):
#
security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
security.provider.2=sun.security.rsa.SunRsaSign
security.provider.3=sun.security.ec.SunEC
security.provider.4=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
security.provider.5=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE
security.provider.6=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider

#
# Sun Provider SecureRandom seed source.
#
# Select the primary source of seed data for the "SHA1PRNG" and
# "NativePRNG" SecureRandom implementations in the "Sun" provider.
# (Other SecureRandom implementations might also use this property.)
#
# On Unix-like systems (for example, Solaris/Linux/MacOS), the
# "NativePRNG" and "SHA1PRNG" implementations obtains seed data from
# special device files such as file:/dev/random.
#
# On Windows systems, specifying the URLs "file:/dev/random" or
# "file:/dev/urandom" will enable the native Microsoft CryptoAPI seeding
# mechanism for SHA1PRNG.
#
# By default, an attempt is made to use the entropy gathering device
# specified by the "securerandom.source" Security property.  If an
# exception occurs while accessing the specified URL:
#
#     SHA1PRNG:
#         the traditional system/thread activity algorithm will be used.
#
#     NativePRNG:
#         a default value of /dev/random will be used.  If neither
#         are available, the implementation will be disabled.
#         "file" is the only currently supported protocol type.
#
# The entropy gathering device can also be specified with the System
# property "java.security.egd". For example:
#
#   % java -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/random MainClass
#
# Specifying this System property will override the
# "securerandom.source" Security property.
#
# In addition, if "file:/dev/random" or "file:/dev/urandom" is
# specified, the "NativePRNG" implementation will be more preferred than
# SHA1PRNG in the Sun provider.

#
# Properties to configure OCSP for certificate revocation checking
#

# Enable OCSP
#
# By default, OCSP is not used for certificate revocation checking.
# This property enables the use of OCSP when set to the value "true".
#
# NOTE: SocketPermission is required to connect to an OCSP responder.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.enable=true

#
# Location of the OCSP responder
#
# By default, the location of the OCSP responder is determined implicitly
# from the certificate being validated. This property explicitly specifies
# the location of the OCSP responder. The property is used when the
# Authority Information Access extension (defined in RFC 5280) is absent
# from the certificate or when it requires overriding.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderURL=http://ocsp.example.net:80

#
# Subject name of the OCSP responder's certificate
#
# By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
# of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
# of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
# distinguished name (defined in RFC 2253) which identifies a certificate in
# the set of certificates supplied during cert path validation. In cases where
# the subject name alone is not sufficient to uniquely identify the certificate
# then both the "ocsp.responderCertIssuerName" and
# "ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber" properties must be used instead. When this
# property is set then those two properties are ignored.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderCertSubjectName="CN=OCSP Responder, O=XYZ Corp"

#
# Issuer name of the OCSP responder's certificate
#
# By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
# of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
# of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
# distinguished name (defined in RFC 2253) which identifies a certificate in
# the set of certificates supplied during cert path validation. When this
# property is set then the "ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber" property must also
# be set. When the "ocsp.responderCertSubjectName" property is set then this
# property is ignored.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderCertIssuerName="CN=Enterprise CA, O=XYZ Corp"

#
# Serial number of the OCSP responder's certificate
#
# By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
# of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
# of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
# of hexadecimal digits (colon or space separators may be present) which
# identifies a certificate in the set of certificates supplied during cert path
# validation. When this property is set then the "ocsp.responderCertIssuerName"
# property must also be set. When the "ocsp.responderCertSubjectName" property
# is set then this property is ignored.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber=2A:FF:00

#
# Policy for failed Kerberos KDC lookups:
#
# When a KDC is unavailable (network error, service failure, etc), it is
# put inside a blacklist and accessed less often for future requests. The
# value (case-insensitive) for this policy can be:
#
# tryLast
#    KDCs in the blacklist are always tried after those not on the list.
#
# tryLess[:max_retries,timeout]
#    KDCs in the blacklist are still tried by their order in the configuration,
#    but with smaller max_retries and timeout values. max_retries and timeout
#    are optional numerical parameters (default 1 and 5000, which means once
#    and 5 seconds). Please notes that if any of the values defined here is
#    more than what is defined in krb5.conf, it will be ignored.
#
# Whenever a KDC is detected as available, it is removed from the blacklist.
# The blacklist is reset when krb5.conf is reloaded. You can add
# refreshKrb5Config=true to a JAAS configuration file so that krb5.conf is
# reloaded whenever a JAAS authentication is attempted.
#
# Example,
#   krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLast
#   krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLess:2,2000
krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLast

#
# Kerberos cross-realm referrals (RFC 6806)
#
# OpenJDK's Kerberos client supports cross-realm referrals as defined in
# RFC 6806. This allows to setup more dynamic environments in which clients
# do not need to know in advance how to reach the realm of a target principal
# (either a user or service).
#
# When a client issues an AS or a TGS request, the "canonicalize" option
# is set to announce support of this feature. A KDC server may fulfill the
# request or reply referring the client to a different one. If referred,
# the client will issue a new request and the cycle repeats.
#
# In addition to referrals, the "canonicalize" option allows the KDC server
# to change the client name in response to an AS request. For security reasons,
# RFC 6806 (section 11) FAST scheme is enforced.
#
# Disable Kerberos cross-realm referrals. Value may be overwritten with a
# System property (-Dsun.security.krb5.disableReferrals).
sun.security.krb5.disableReferrals=false

# Maximum number of AS or TGS referrals to avoid infinite loops. Value may

# Algorithm restrictions for certification path (CertPath) processing
#
# In some environments, certain algorithms or key lengths may be undesirable
# for certification path building and validation.  For example, "MD2" is
# generally no longer considered to be a secure hash algorithm.  This section
# describes the mechanism for disabling algorithms based on algorithm name
# and/or key length.  This includes algorithms used in certificates, as well
# as revocation information such as CRLs and signed OCSP Responses.
# The syntax of the disabled algorithm string is described as follows:
#   DisabledAlgorithms:
#       " DisabledAlgorithm { , DisabledAlgorithm } "
#
#   DisabledAlgorithm:
#       AlgorithmName [Constraint] { '&' Constraint } | IncludeProperty
#
#   AlgorithmName:
#       (see below)
#
#   Constraint:
#       KeySizeConstraint | CAConstraint | DenyAfterConstraint |
#       UsageConstraint
#
#   KeySizeConstraint:
#       keySize Operator KeyLength
#
#   Operator:
#       <= | < | == | != | >= | >
#
#   KeyLength:
#       Integer value of the algorithm's key length in bits
#
#   CAConstraint:
#       jdkCA
#
#   DenyAfterConstraint:
#       denyAfter YYYY-MM-DD
#
#   UsageConstraint:
#       usage [TLSServer] [TLSClient] [SignedJAR]
#
#   IncludeProperty:
#       include <security property>
#
# The "AlgorithmName" is the standard algorithm name of the disabled
# algorithm. See "Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name
# Documentation" for information about Standard Algorithm Names.  Matching
# is performed using a case-insensitive sub-element matching rule.  (For
# example, in "SHA1withECDSA" the sub-elements are "SHA1" for hashing and
# "ECDSA" for signatures.)  If the assertion "AlgorithmName" is a
# sub-element of the certificate algorithm name, the algorithm will be
# rejected during certification path building and validation.  For example,
# the assertion algorithm name "DSA" will disable all certificate algorithms
# that rely on DSA, such as NONEwithDSA, SHA1withDSA.  However, the assertion
# will not disable algorithms related to "ECDSA".
#
# The "IncludeProperty" allows a implementation-defined security property that
# can be included in the disabledAlgorithms properties.  These properties are
# to help manage common actions easier across multiple disabledAlgorithm
# properties.
# There is one defined security property:  jdk.disabled.NamedCurves
# See the property for more specific details.
#
#
# A "Constraint" defines restrictions on the keys and/or certificates for
# a specified AlgorithmName:
#
#   KeySizeConstraint:
#     keySize Operator KeyLength
#       The constraint requires a key of a valid size range if the
#       "AlgorithmName" is of a key algorithm.  The "KeyLength" indicates
#       the key size specified in number of bits.  For example,
#       "RSA keySize <= 1024" indicates that any RSA key with key size less
#       than or equal to 1024 bits should be disabled, and
#       "RSA keySize < 1024, RSA keySize > 2048" indicates that any RSA key
#       with key size less than 1024 or greater than 2048 should be disabled.
#       This constraint is only used on algorithms that have a key size.
#
#   CAConstraint:
#     jdkCA
#       This constraint prohibits the specified algorithm only if the
#       algorithm is used in a certificate chain that terminates at a marked
#       trust anchor in the lib/security/cacerts keystore.  If the jdkCA
#       constraint is not set, then all chains using the specified algorithm
#       are restricted.  jdkCA may only be used once in a DisabledAlgorithm
#       expression.
#       Example:  To apply this constraint to SHA-1 certificates, include
#       the following:  "SHA1 jdkCA"
#
#   DenyAfterConstraint:
#     denyAfter YYYY-MM-DD
#       This constraint prohibits a certificate with the specified algorithm
#       from being used after the date regardless of the certificate's
#       validity.  JAR files that are signed and timestamped before the
#       constraint date with certificates containing the disabled algorithm
#       will not be restricted.  The date is processed in the UTC timezone.
#       This constraint can only be used once in a DisabledAlgorithm
#       expression.
#       Example:  To deny usage of RSA 2048 bit certificates after Feb 3 2020,
#       use the following:  "RSA keySize == 2048 & denyAfter 2020-02-03"
#
#   UsageConstraint:
#     usage [TLSServer] [TLSClient] [SignedJAR]
#       This constraint prohibits the specified algorithm for
#       a specified usage.  This should be used when disabling an algorithm
#       for all usages is not practical. 'TLSServer' restricts the algorithm
#       in TLS server certificate chains when server authentication is
#       performed. 'TLSClient' restricts the algorithm in TLS client
#       certificate chains when client authentication is performed.
#       'SignedJAR' constrains use of certificates in signed jar files.
#       The usage type follows the keyword and more than one usage type can
#       be specified with a whitespace delimiter.
#       Example:  "SHA1 usage TLSServer TLSClient"
#
# When an algorithm must satisfy more than one constraint, it must be
# delimited by an ampersand '&'.  For example, to restrict certificates in a
# chain that terminate at a distribution provided trust anchor and contain
# RSA keys that are less than or equal to 1024 bits, add the following
# constraint:  "RSA keySize <= 1024 & jdkCA".
#
# All DisabledAlgorithms expressions are processed in the order defined in the
# property.  This requires lower keysize constraints to be specified
# before larger keysize constraints of the same algorithm.  For example:
# "RSA keySize < 1024 & jdkCA, RSA keySize < 2048".
#
# Note: The algorithm restrictions do not apply to trust anchors or
# self-signed certificates.

# Legacy algorithms for Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
# processing in JSSE implementation.
#
# In some environments, a certain algorithm may be undesirable but it
# cannot be disabled because of its use in legacy applications.  Legacy
# algorithms may still be supported, but applications should not use them
# as the security strength of legacy algorithms are usually not strong enough
# in practice.
#
# During SSL/TLS security parameters negotiation, legacy algorithms will
# not be negotiated unless there are no other candidates.
#
# The syntax of the legacy algorithms string is described as this Java
# BNF-style:
#   LegacyAlgorithms:
#       " LegacyAlgorithm { , LegacyAlgorithm } "
#
#   LegacyAlgorithm:
#       AlgorithmName (standard JSSE algorithm name)
#
# See the specification of security property "jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms"
# for the syntax and description of the "AlgorithmName" notation.
#
# Per SSL/TLS specifications, cipher suites have the form:
#       SSL_KeyExchangeAlg_WITH_CipherAlg_MacAlg
# or
#       TLS_KeyExchangeAlg_WITH_CipherAlg_MacAlg
#
# For example, the cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA uses RSA as the
# key exchange algorithm, AES_128_CBC (128 bits AES cipher algorithm in CBC
# mode) as the cipher (encryption) algorithm, and SHA-1 as the message digest
# algorithm for HMAC.
#
# The LegacyAlgorithm can be one of the following standard algorithm names:
#     1. JSSE cipher suite name, e.g., TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
#     2. JSSE key exchange algorithm name, e.g., RSA
#     3. JSSE cipher (encryption) algorithm name, e.g., AES_128_CBC

#
# Whitespace characters are ignored.
#
# The "DefinedDHEParameters" defines the custom group parameters, prime

#
# If this property is not defined or the value is empty, the underlying JSSE

# Cryptographic Jurisdiction Policy defaults
#
# Import and export control rules on cryptographic software vary from
# country to country.  By default, the JDK provides two different sets of
# cryptographic policy files:
#
#     unlimited:  These policy files contain no restrictions on cryptographic
#                 strengths or algorithms.
#
#     limited:    These policy files contain more restricted cryptographic
#                 strengths, and are still available if your country or
#                 usage requires the traditional restrictive policy.
#
# The JDK JCE framework uses the unlimited policy files by default.
# However the user may explicitly choose a set either by defining the
# "crypto.policy" Security property or by installing valid JCE policy
# jar files into the traditional JDK installation location.  To better
# support older JDK Update releases, the "crypto.policy" property is not
# defined by default.  See below for more information.
#
# The following logic determines which policy files are used:
#
#         <java-home> refers to the directory where the JRE was
#         installed and may be determined using the "java.home"
#         System property.
#
# 1.  If the Security property "crypto.policy" has been defined,
#     then the following mechanism is used:
#
#     The policy files are stored as jar files in subdirectories of
# <java-home>/lib/security/policy.  Each directory contains a complete
# set of policy files.
#
#     The "crypto.policy" Security property controls the directory
#     selection, and thus the effective cryptographic policy.
#
# The default set of directories is:
#
#     limited | unlimited
#
# 2.  If the "crypto.policy" property is not set and the traditional
#     US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar files
#     (e.g. limited/unlimited) are found in the legacy
#     <java-home>/lib/security directory, then the rules embedded within
#     those jar files will be used. This helps preserve compatibility
# for users upgrading from an older installation.
#
# 3.  If the jar files are not present in the legacy location
#     and the "crypto.policy" Security property is not defined,
#     then the JDK will use the unlimited settings (equivalent to
#     crypto.policy=unlimited)
#
# Please see the JCA documentation for additional information on these
# files and formats.
#
# YOU ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT YOUR EXPORT/IMPORT CONTROL COUNSEL OR ATTORNEY
# TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS.
#
# Please note that the JCE for Java SE, including the JCE framework,
# cryptographic policy files, and standard JCE providers provided with
# the Java SE, have been reviewed and approved for export as mass market
# encryption item by the US Bureau of Industry and Security.

# Serialization process-wide filter
#
# A filter, if configured, is used by java.io.ObjectInputStream during
# deserialization to check the contents of the stream.
# A filter is configured as a sequence of patterns, each pattern is either
# matched against the name of a class in the stream or defines a limit.
# Patterns are separated by ";" (semicolon).
# Whitespace is significant and is considered part of the pattern.
#
# If the system property jdk.serialFilter is also specified on the command
# line, it supersedes the security property value defined here.
#
# If a pattern includes a "=", it sets a limit.
# If a limit appears more than once the last value is used.
# Limits are checked before classes regardless of the order in the sequence of patterns.
# If any of the limits are exceeded, the filter status is REJECTED.
#
#   maxdepth=value - the maximum depth of a graph
#   maxrefs=value  - the maximum number of internal references
#   maxbytes=value - the maximum number of bytes in the input stream
#   maxarray=value - the maximum array length allowed
#
# Other patterns, from left to right, match the class or package name as
# returned from Class.getName.
# If the class is an array type, the class or package to be matched is the element type.
# Arrays of any number of dimensions are treated the same as the element type.
# For example, a pattern of "!example.Foo", rejects creation of any instance or
# array of example.Foo.
#
# If the pattern starts with "!", the status is REJECTED if the remaining pattern
#   is matched; otherwise the status is ALLOWED if the pattern matches.
# If the pattern ends with ".**" it matches any class in the package and all subpackages.
# If the pattern ends with ".*" it matches any class in the package.
# If the pattern ends with "*", it matches any class with the pattern as a prefix.
# If the pattern is equal to the class name, it matches.
# Otherwise, the status is UNDECIDED.
#
# Primitive types are not configurable with this filter.

# RMI Registry Serial Filter
#
# The filter pattern uses the same format as jdk.serialFilter.
# This filter can override the builtin filter if additional types need to be

# to increase limits.
# If the limits (maxdepth, maxrefs, or maxbytes) are exceeded, the object is rejected.
#
# The maxdepth of any array passed to the RMI Registry is set to

#
# An IOR type check filter, if configured, is used by an ORB during

#
# The filter pattern consists of a semi-colon separated list of class names.
# The configured list contains the binary class names of the IDL interface types
# corresponding to the IDL stub class to be instantiated.
# As such, a filter specifies a list of IDL stub classes that will be

# PKCS12 KeyStore properties
#
# The following properties, if configured, are used by the PKCS12 KeyStore
# implementation during the creation of a new keystore. Several of the
# properties may also be used when modifying an existing keystore. The
# properties can be overridden by a KeyStore API that specifies its own
# algorithms and parameters.
#
# If an existing PKCS12 keystore is loaded and then stored, the algorithm and
# parameter used to generate the existing Mac will be reused. If the existing
# keystore does not have a Mac, no Mac will be created while storing. If there
# is at least one certificate in the existing keystore, the algorithm and
# parameters used to encrypt the last certificate in the existing keystore will
# be reused to encrypt all certificates while storing. If the last certificate
# in the existing keystore is not encrypted, all certificates will be stored
# unencrypted. If there is no certificate in the existing keystore, any newly
# added certificate will be encrypted (or stored unencrypted if algorithm
# value is "NONE") using the "keystore.pkcs12.certProtectionAlgorithm" and
# "keystore.pkcs12.certPbeIterationCount" values defined here. Existing private
# and secret key(s) are not changed. Newly set private and secret key(s) will
# be encrypted using the "keystore.pkcs12.keyProtectionAlgorithm" and
# "keystore.pkcs12.keyPbeIterationCount" values defined here.
#
# In order to apply new algorithms and parameters to all entries in an
# existing keystore, one can create a new keystore and add entries in the
# existing keystore into the new keystore. This can be achieved by calling the
# "keytool -importkeystore" command.
#
# If a system property of the same name is also specified, it supersedes the
# security property value defined here.
#
# If the property is set to an illegal value,
# an iteration count that is not a positive integer, or an unknown algorithm
# name, an exception will be thrown when the property is used.
# If the property is not set or empty, a default value will be used.
#
# Note: These properties are currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
# They are not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.

# The algorithm used to encrypt a certificate. This can be any non-Hmac PBE

# Disabled mechanisms for the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
#
# Disabled mechanisms will not be negotiated by both SASL clients and servers.
# These mechanisms will be ignored if they are specified in the "mechanisms"

#
# The value of this property is a comma-separated list of SASL mechanisms.

# Policies for distrusting Certificate Authorities (CAs).
#
# This is a comma separated value of one or more case-sensitive strings, each
# of which represents a policy for determining if a CA should be distrusted.
# The supported values are:
#
#
#   SYMANTEC_TLS : Distrust TLS Server certificates anchored by a Symantec
#   root CA and issued after April 16, 2019 unless issued by one of the
#   following subordinate CAs which have a later distrust date:
#     1. Apple IST CA 2 - G1, SHA-256 fingerprint:
#        AC2B922ECFD5E01711772FEA8ED372DE9D1E2245FCE3F57A9CDBEC77296A424B

# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
# It is not guaranteed to be supported by other SE implementations. Also, this
# property does not override other security properties which can restrict

#
# Policies for the proxy_impersonator Kerberos ccache configuration entry
#
# The proxy_impersonator ccache configuration entry indicates that the ccache
# is a synthetic delegated credential for use with S4U2Proxy by an intermediate
# server. The ccache file should also contain the TGT of this server and
# an evidence ticket from the default principal of the ccache to this server.
#
# This security property determines how Java uses this configuration entry.
# There are 3 possible values:
#
#  no-impersonate     - Ignore this configuration entry, and always act as
#                       the owner of the TGT (if it exists).
#
#  try-impersonate    - Try impersonation when this configuration entry exists.
#                       If no matching TGT or evidence ticket is found,
#                       fallback to no-impersonate.
#
#  always-impersonate - Always impersonate when this configuration entry exists.
#                       If no matching TGT or evidence ticket is found,
#                       no initial credential is read from the ccache.
#
# The default value is "always-impersonate".
#
# If a system property of the same name is also specified, it supersedes the
# security property value defined here.
#
#jdk.security.krb5.default.initiate.credential=always-impersonate

#
# Trust Anchor Certificates - CA Basic Constraint check
#
# X.509 v3 certificates used as Trust Anchors (to validate signed code or TLS
# connections) must have the cA Basic Constraint field set to 'true'. Also, if
# they include a Key Usage extension, the keyCertSign bit must be set. These
# checks, enabled by default, can be disabled for backward-compatibility
# purposes with the jdk.security.allowNonCaAnchor System and Security
# properties. In the case that both properties are simultaneously set, the
# System value prevails. The default value of the property is "false".
#
#jdk.security.allowNonCaAnchor=true

#
# The default Character set name (java.nio.charset.Charset.forName())
# for converting TLS ALPN values between byte arrays and Strings.
# Prior versions of the JDK may use UTF-8 as the default charset. If

# may help.

# jdk.tls.alpnCharset=UTF-8
jdk.tls.alpnCharset=ISO_8859_1

#
# JNDI Object Factories Filter
#
# This filter is used by the JNDI runtime to control the set of object factory classes
# which will be allowed to instantiate objects from object references returned by
# naming/directory systems. The factory class named by the reference instance will be
# matched against this filter. The filter property supports pattern-based filter syntax
# with the same format as jdk.serialFilter.
#
# Each pattern is matched against the factory class name to allow or disallow it's
# instantiation. The access to a factory class is allowed unless the filter returns
# REJECTED.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
# It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
#
# If the system property jdk.jndi.object.factoriesFilter is also specified, it supersedes
# the security property value defined here. The default value of the property is "*".
#
# The default pattern value allows any object factory class specified by the reference
# instance to recreate the referenced object.
#jdk.jndi.object.factoriesFilter=*
