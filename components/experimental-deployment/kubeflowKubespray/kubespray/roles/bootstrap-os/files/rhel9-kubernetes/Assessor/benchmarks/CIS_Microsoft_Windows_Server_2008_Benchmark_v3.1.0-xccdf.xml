   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS. CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. USER AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS. CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1. Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights." Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0.

               <xhtml:p>This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "pass phrase" is a better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid pass phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.</xhtml:p>

If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about pass phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover.</xhtml:p>

            <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
               <xhtml:p>This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: -- Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>-- Be at least six characters in length</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>-- Contain characters from three of the following four categories:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>---- English uppercase characters (A through Z)</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>---- English lowercase characters (a through z)</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>---- Base 10 digits (0 through 9)</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>---- Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>---- A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The recommended state for this setting is: <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Enabled</xhtml:span>.</xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:p>If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p>If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Passfilt.dll</xhtml:span> file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments.</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p>Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs.

Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the Domain Controllers.</xhtml:p>

            <xccdf:rationale xml:lang="en">
               <xhtml:p>Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.</xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:p>This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users.

Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account has a well-known security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name.

This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the computer restarts.</xhtml:p>

For more information on how to identify whether your DCs are being accessed via unsigned LDAP (and where those accesses are coming from), see this Microsoft TechNet blog article: <xhtml:a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/russellt/2016/01/13/identifying-clear-text-ldap-binds-to-your-dcs/">Identifying Clear Text LDAP binds to your DC’s – Practical Windows Security</xhtml:a>

                  <xhtml:p>Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Additionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be received over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception of account passwords by other systems on the network.</xhtml:p>

SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.</xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called Homegroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Spnego.dll</xhtml:span>. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Negoexts.dll</xhtml:span>, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.</xhtml:p>

The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>Join a domain</xhtml:li>

                     <xhtml:li>Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain</xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:p>The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The recommended state for this setting is: <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM &amp; NTLM</xhtml:span>.</xhtml:p>

               <xccdf:rationale xml:lang="en">
                  <xhtml:p>Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or higher Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM &amp; NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.</xhtml:p>

For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these programs was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator" because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two ways:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:ul>
                     <xhtml:li>If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create one if a local administrator account is warranted.</xhtml:li>
                  </xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:p>Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled, but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters.

                  <xhtml:p>In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk in Group Policy as part of the <xhtml:a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS15-011">MS15-011</xhtml:a> / <xhtml:a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000483">MSKB 3000483</xhtml:a> security update. This mechanism requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server 2008 (non-R2) or higher (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not released for Server 2003). A new group policy template (<xhtml:span class="inline_block">NetworkProvider.admx/adml</xhtml:span>) was also provided with the security update.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to remediate the Group Policy security risk:</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">\\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong> A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the above paths.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>Additional guidance on the deployment of this security setting is available from the Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE) Platforms TechNet Blog here: <xhtml:a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/askpfeplat/archive/2015/02/23/guidance-on-deployment-of-ms15-011-and-ms15-014.aspx">Guidance on Deployment of MS15-011 and MS15-014</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>EMET is free and supported security software developed by Microsoft that allows an enterprise to apply exploit mitigations to applications that run on Windows. Many of these mitigations were later coded directly into Windows 10 and Server 2016.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong> Although EMET is quite effective at enhancing exploit protection on Windows server OSes prior to Server 2016, it is highly recommended that compatibility testing is done on typical server configurations (including all CIS-recommended EMET settings) before widespread deployment to your environment.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:strong>Note #2:</xhtml:strong> EMET has been reported to be very problematic on 32-bit OSes - we only recommend using it with 64-bit OSes.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:strong>Note #3:</xhtml:strong> Microsoft has announced that EMET will be End-Of-Life (EOL) on July 31, 2018. This does not mean the software will stop working, only that Microsoft will not update it any further past that date, nor troubleshoot new problems with it.

                  <xhtml:p>The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is free and supported security software developed by Microsoft that allows an enterprise to apply exploit mitigations to applications that run on Windows. Many of these mitigations were later coded directly into Windows 10 and Server 2016.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>More information on EMET, including download and User Guide, can be obtained here:</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong> Although EMET is quite effective at enhancing exploit protection on Windows server OSes prior to Server 2016, it is highly recommended that compatibility testing is done on typical server configurations (including all CIS-recommended EMET settings) before widespread deployment to your environment.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Note #2:</xhtml:strong> Microsoft has announced that EMET will be End-Of-Life (EOL) on July 31, 2018. This does not mean the software will stop working, only that Microsoft will not update it any further past that date, nor troubleshoot new problems with it. They are instead recommending that servers be upgraded to Server 2016.</xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:p>
                     <xhtml:strong>Note #3:</xhtml:strong> EMET has been reported to be very problematic on 32-bit OSes - we only recommend using it with 64-bit OSes.</xhtml:p>

For systems that limit the number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an effective denial of service. This setting is important to ensure a disconnected session is properly terminated.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>This setting controls whether users are permitted to change installation options that typically are available only to system administrators. The security features of Windows Installer normally prevent users from changing installation options that are typically reserved for system administrators, such as specifying the directory to which files are installed. If Windows Installer detects that an installation package has permitted the user to change a protected option, it stops the installation and displays a message. These security features operate only when the installation program is running in a privileged security context in which it has access to directories denied to the user.</xhtml:p>

                     <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong> In Microsoft's own hardening guidance, they recommend the opposite value, <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Enabled</xhtml:span>, because having this data logged improves investigations of PowerShell attack incidents. However, the default ACL on the PowerShell Operational log allows Interactive User (i.e. <xhtml:em>any</xhtml:em> logged on user) to read it, and therefore possibly expose passwords or other sensitive information to unauthorized users. If Microsoft locks down the default ACL on that log in the future (e.g. to restrict it only to Administrators), then we will revisit this recommendation in a future release.</xhtml:p>
