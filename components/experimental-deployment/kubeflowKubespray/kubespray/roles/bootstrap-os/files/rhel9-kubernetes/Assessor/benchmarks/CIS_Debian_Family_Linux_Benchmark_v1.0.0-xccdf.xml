    <xhtml:p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Debian derived Linux systems running on x86 and x64 platforms.</xhtml:p>
    <xhtml:p>Commands and scripts are provided which should work on most Debian derived Linux distributions, however some translation to local styles may be required in places.</xhtml:p>
    <xhtml:p>Many lists are included including filesystem types, services, clients, and network protocols. Not all items in these lists are guaranteed to exist on all distributions and additional similar items may exist which should be considered in addition to those explicitly mentioned.</xhtml:p>
    <xhtml:p>The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user. Operations performed using sudo instead of the root user may produce unexpected results, or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.</xhtml:p>
    <xhtml:p>The guidance in this document includes changes to the running system configuration.  Failure to test system configuration changes in a test environment prior to implementation on a production system could lead to loss of services.</xhtml:p>

  <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

        <xhtml:p>Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:em>
Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 directory, this data will still consume space in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 once the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 filesystem is mounted unless it is removed first.          </xhtml:em>

          <xhtml:p>A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.</xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.</xhtml:p>

This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment. When snaps are deployed on versions of Linux, the Ubuntu app store is used as default back-end, but other stores can be enabled as well.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>Debian Family Linux distributions use apt to install and update software packages. Patch management procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises may choose to install a local updates server that can be used in place of their distributions servers, whereas a single deployment of a system may prefer to get updates directly. Updates can be performed automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for patch management. Many large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-production system before rolling out to production.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>For the purpose of this benchmark, the requirement is to ensure that a patch management system is configured and maintained. The specifics on patch update procedures are left to the organization.</xhtml:p>

Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.</xhtml:p>

          <xhtml:p>AppArmor provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under AppArmor MAC rules are applied by file paths instead of by security contexts as in other MAC systems. As such it does not require support in the filesystem and can be applied to network mounted filesystems for example. AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can access and what privileges they can do so with. This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, AppArmor rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>
Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system. The           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/motd</xhtml:span>
,           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/issue</xhtml:span>
, and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/issue.net</xhtml:span>
 files govern warning banners for standard command line logins for both local and remote users.        </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>
Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.

Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that are in place.

            <xhtml:p>systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group "systemd-timesync" needs to be created on installation of systemd.</xhtml:p>

When             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tcp_syncookies</xhtml:span>

SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.          </xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>A firewall is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>To provide a Host Based Firewall, the Linux kernel includes support for:</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:ul>
          <xhtml:li>Netfilter - A set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack. A registered callback function is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.  Includes the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel modules. These modules are some of the significant parts of the Netfilter hook system.</xhtml:li>
          <xhtml:li>
nftables - A subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames. nftables is supposed to replace certain parts of Netfilter, while keeping and reusing most of it. nftables utilizes the building blocks of the Netfilter infrastructure, such as the existing hooks into the networking stack, connection tracking system, userspace queueing component, and logging subsystem.              <xhtml:em>Is available in Linux kernels 3.13 and newer</xhtml:em>
.          </xhtml:li>
        </xhtml:ul>
        <xhtml:p>In order to configure firewall rules for Netfilter or nftables, a firewall utility needs to be installed.  Guidance has been included for the following firewall utilities:</xhtml:p>

UncomplicatedFirewall (ufw) - Provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables backend.              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ufw</xhtml:span>
 supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks          </xhtml:li>
          <xhtml:li>nftables - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the Linux kernel</xhtml:li>
          <xhtml:li>iptables - Includes the iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables utilities for configuration Netfilter and the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel modules.</xhtml:li>

            <xhtml:em>If Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) or iptables are being used in your environment, please follow the guidance in their respective section and pass-over the guidance in this section.</xhtml:em>
          </xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames and is the successor to iptables.  The biggest change with the successor nftables is its simplicity. With iptables, we have to configure every single rule and use the syntax which can be compared with normal commands.  With nftables, the simpler syntax, much like BPF (Berkely Packet Filter) means shorter lines and less repetition.  Support for nftables should also be compiled into the kernel, together with the related nftables modules. Please ensure that your kernel supports nf_tables before choosing this option.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
              <xhtml:em>Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty IPtables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with iptables -F). Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere:</xhtml:em>

            <xhtml:p>Ip6tables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv6 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.
Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>If IPv6 in enabled on the system, the ip6tables should be configured.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
              <xhtml:em>Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty ip6tables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with ip6tables -F). Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot.</xhtml:em>

    <xccdf:title xml:lang="en">Logging and Auditing</xccdf:title>
    <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
      <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
It is recommended that         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 be used for logging (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logwatch</xhtml:span>
 providing summarization) and         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
 be used for auditing (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aureport</xhtml:span>
 providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.      </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:em>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:em>
        <xhtml:em>
There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (          <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>
). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640</xhtml:span>
 where           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp</xhtml:span>
 is the defined security group (in some cases           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>
).        </xhtml:em>

        <xhtml:p>
System auditing, through           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
, allows system administrators to monitor their systems such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd will audit AppArmor AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be logged to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit/audit.log</xhtml:span>
. The recording of these events will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated.        </xhtml:p>

Several recommendations in this section filter based off of               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auid&gt;=1000</xhtml:span>
 for unprivileged non-system users. Some systems may have a non-default UID_MIN setting, consult the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">UID_MIN</xhtml:span>
 setting in               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/login.defs</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:em>
The audits in this section look for a               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">key</xhtml:span>
 value. The               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">key value</xhtml:span>
 may be different for the audit rules on your system. If a different               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">key</xhtml:span>
 value, denoted by               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">-k</xhtml:span>
 or               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">key=</xhtml:span>
 is used on your system, please replace the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">grep &lt;key_value&gt;</xhtml:span>

Once all audit rules have been added to a file or files in the               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/rules.d/</xhtml:span>

It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 file systems to the system. While tracking             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">open</xhtml:span>
 ,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">creat</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">truncate</xhtml:span>
 system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.          </xhtml:p>

 sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.            </xhtml:li>

          <xhtml:p>SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines</xhtml:p>

          <xhtml:p>Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-doors.</xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network</xhtml:p>

The user file-creation mode mask (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

The Debian package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--verify</xhtml:span>
 option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">--verify</xhtml:span>
  option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option:          </xhtml:p>

The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">dpkg -S</xhtml:span>
