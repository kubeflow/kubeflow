   <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
      <xhtml:p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for OpenShift 4.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>The set of configuration files mentioned throughout this benchmark are specific to Red Hat’s CNCF certified Kubernetes distribution, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>Each section includes information about the default configuration of an OpenShift cluster and a set of recommendations for hardening the configuration, inspired by the CIS Kubernetes benchmark. For each hardening recommendation, information on how to implement the control and/or how to verify or audit the control is provided. In some cases, remediation information is also provided.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>The majority of the settings in the hardening guide are in place by default. The audit information for these settings is provided so that you can verify that the cluster admin has not made changes that would be less secure than the OpenShift defaults. A small number of items require configuration. Finally, there are some recommendations that require decisions by the customer, such as audit log size, retention and related settings.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>The recommendations that require decisions based on your needs are:</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:ul>
         <xhtml:li>Configure encryption of data at rest in etcd datastore</xhtml:li>
         <xhtml:li>Manage Image Provenance</xhtml:li>
         <xhtml:li>Set the --event-qps argument as appropriate</xhtml:li>
         <xhtml:li>Configure the API server audit log retention</xhtml:li>
         <xhtml:li>Configure cluster logging to forward audit logs off the cluster</xhtml:li>
         <xhtml:li>Configure the audit log file size</xhtml:li>
         <xhtml:li>Adjust the garbage collection settings as needed</xhtml:li>
         <xhtml:li>Create custom Security Context Constraints as needed</xhtml:li>
         <xhtml:li>Configure Network Policies as appropriate</xhtml:li>
         <xhtml:li>In OCP 4.6 and above, configure audit policies as appropriate</xhtml:li>

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

OpenShift includes two API servers, the OpenShift API server and the Kubernetes API server. All API calls are directed to the Open Shift API server and then Kubernetes objects are delegated to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">kube-apiserver</xhtml:span>

The cluster configuration resource (CR) APIServer holds configuration settings (like serving certificates, client CA and CORS domains) shared by all API servers in the system, among them especially           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">kube-apiserver</xhtml:span>
 and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">openshift-apiserver</xhtml:span>
. The canonical name of an instance is 'cluster'. Changes to the API server configurations should be done in the APIServer custom resource definition (CRD): apiservers.config.openshift.io        </xhtml:p>

Using             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">EventRateLimit</xhtml:span>
 admission control enforces a limit on the number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice. A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and DoS the API Server, making it unavailable. This particularly applies to a multi-tenant cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall. Hence, it is recommended to limit the rate of events that the API server will accept.          </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>
Setting admission control policy to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">AlwaysPullImages</xhtml:span>
 forces every new pod to pull the required images every time. In a multi-tenant cluster users can be assured that their private images can only be used by those who have the credentials to pull them. Without this admission control policy, once an image has been pulled to a node, any pod from any user can use it simply by knowing the image’s name, without any authorization check against the image ownership. When this plug-in is enabled, images are always pulled prior to starting containers, which means valid credentials are required.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
However, turning on this admission plugin can introduce new kinds of cluster failure modes. OpenShift 4 master and infrastructure components are deployed as pods. Enabling this feature can result in cases where loss of contact to an image registry can cause a redeployed infrastructure pod (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">oauth-server</xhtml:span>
 for example) to fail on an image pull for an image that is currently present on the node. We use             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PullIfNotPresent</xhtml:span>
 so that a loss of image registry access does not prevent the pod from starting.  If it becomes             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PullAlways</xhtml:span>
, then an image registry access outage can cause key infrastructure components to fail.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
This can be managed per container. When OpenShift Container Platform creates containers, it uses the container’s             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">imagePullPolicy</xhtml:span>
 to determine if the image should be pulled prior to starting the container. There are three possible values for             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">imagePullPolicy</xhtml:span>
:             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Always</xhtml:span>
,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">IfNotPresent</xhtml:span>
,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Never</xhtml:span>
. If a container’s             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">imagePullPolicy</xhtml:span>
 parameter is not specified, OpenShift Container Platform sets it based on the image’s tag. If the tag is latest, OpenShift Container Platform defaults             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">imagePullPolicy</xhtml:span>
 to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Always</xhtml:span>
. Otherwise, OpenShift Container Platform defaults             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">imagePullPolicy</xhtml:span>
 to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">IfNotPresent</xhtml:span>

 objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system. Pod Security Policies are composed of settings and strategies that control the security features a pod has access to and hence this must be used to control pod access permissions.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
Note: When the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PodSecurityPolicy</xhtml:span>
 admission plugin is in use, there needs to be at least one             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PodSecurityPolicy</xhtml:span>
 in place for ANY pods to be admitted. See section 5.2 for recommendations on             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">PodSecurityPolicy</xhtml:span>
 settings.          </xhtml:p>

 namespace automatically with default roles and                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rolebindings</xhtml:span>
 that are auto-reconciled on startup.                </xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p>
If using other authorization methods (ABAC, Webhook, etc), the cluster deployer is responsible for granting appropriate permissions to the service accounts (the required permissions can be seen by inspecting the                   <xhtml:span class="inline_block">controller-roles.yaml</xhtml:span>

         <xhtml:p>This section covers recommendations for etcd configuration.
The OpenShift cluster-etcd-operator (CEO) is an operator that handles the scaling of etcd during cluster bootstrap and regular operation. The operator also manages provisioning etcd dependencies such as TLS certificates.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>OpenShift uses X.509 certificates to provide secure communication to etcd. OpenShift generates these files and sets the arguments appropriately. etcd certificates are used for encrypted communication between etcd member peers, as well as encrypted client traffic. The following certificates are generated and used by etcd and other processes that communicate with etcd:</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>Peer certificates: Used for communication between etcd members.</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Client certificates: Used for encrypted server-client communication. Client certificates are currently used by the API server only, and no other service should connect to etcd directly except for the proxy. Client secrets (etcd-client, etcd-metric-client, etcd-metric-signer, and etcd-signer) are added to the openshift-config, openshift-monitoring, and openshift-kube-apiserver namespaces.</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Server certificates: Used by the etcd server for authenticating client requests.</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Metric certificates: All metric consumers connect to proxy with metric-client certificates.</xhtml:li>

 causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Note: This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Similar to the way that RBAC resources control user access, administrators can use Security Context Constraints (SCCs) to control permissions for pods. These permissions include actions that a pod, a collection of containers, can perform and what resources it can access. You can use SCCs to define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>By default, OpenShift 4 is configured with multiple SCCs. You can query SCCs with the following command:</xhtml:p>

For example, you can have an SCC that restricts the ability to launch privileged containers and assign that SCC to all authenticated users. As a result, users requesting a pod that contains a privileged container will be rejected.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
You can find more information on SCCs in the OpenShift             <xhtml:a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html">documentation</xhtml:a>

Limiting the scope of user permissions can reduce the impact of mistakes or malicious activities. A Kubernetes namespace allows you to partition created resources into logically named groups.
