#
# Use the CIS-CAT properties file to enable user-level properties used during
# program execution.
#
# For example, to set a value at runtime for a benchmark value marked as
# "interactive", create a property with a name of the <Value> @id and a value
# equal to the string value to be set.
#
# Using a properties file format such as this eliminates the need to edit XML
# and allows multiple CIS-CAT instances to reference the same XCCDF benchmark
# using different interactive parameter values.
#
# For example, the below property sets the value to be used for the JDBC
# connection URL in a database benchmark.
#
# xccdf_org.cisecurity_value_jdbc.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:sys/password1@localhost:1521:CISDB1
#
#Example of setting an ESXi host connection string interactive value:
#
#xccdf_org.cisecurity.benchmarks_value_esxi.connection=user/password@host
#
# NOTE:  When setting values which are Windows file paths, users MUST configure
#        the path separator using either:
#
#        Unix-style path separator "/" such as:
#          ORACLE_HOME=C:/oracle/product/11.2.0/dbhome_1
#
#        or by using an "escaped" Windows path separator "\\" such as:
#          ORACLE_HOME=C:\\oracle\\product\\11.2.0\\dbhome_1

##################################################################################Controls Assessment Module (CAM) - Implementation Group 1 (IG1)#####################################################################################

##################################################################################---------------------CAM IG1 Customizable Values------------------##################################################################################
##The values below are used by CAM's automated checks.  These values be customized as appropriate for your organization.

##Sub-Control 4.2 Required Minimum Password Length - The required minimum number of characters for password policy for sub-control 4.2 (Windows will not accept values larger than 14).  The CAM default is 14 characters which is consistent with the Windows Benchmark.  
xccdf_org.cisecurity_value_4.2_var=14

##Sub-Control 10.2 Maximum Days Without Backup - The maximum number of days allowed without a backup for sub-controls 10.1 and 10.2  The CAM default is 7 days.
xccdf_org.cisecurity_value_10.2_var=7

##Sub-Control 16.9 Maximum Inactivity Days - The maximum number of days allowed for an account to be inactive before being considered dormant for sub-control 16.9  The CAM default is 30 days.
xccdf_org.cisecurity_value_16.9_var=30

##Sub-Control 16.11 Maximum Screen Lock Timeout - The maximum number of seconds allowed for the lock screen timeout in order to pass sub-control 16.11  The CAM default is 900 seconds (15 minutes) which is consistent with the Windows Benchmark.
xccdf_org.cisecurity_value_16.11_var=900


##################################################################################---------------------CAM IG1 Survey Questions------------------##################################################################################
##For the IG1 sub-controls that do not have automated checks in CAM (generally the more procedural sub-controls), survey questions are provided to assess the implementation of those sub-controls.
##Answers for these survey questions can be provided in either of two ways:
##	1) Saved: Answers can be saved in this file in the appropriate answer lines below.  These saved answers will be applied to successive CAM IG1 runs without prompting the user for answers inside of CIS-CAT Assessor.
##		These saved answers can be updated as the organization's implementation of these sub-controls changes over time by setting the value to a 'y' or an 'n' below.  The updated answer will be used for future runs of CAM IG1.
##	2) Interactive: Answers can be provided by the user interactively inside of CIS-CAT Assessor during a run of CAM IG1.  
##		Interactive questions will appear in the command prompt where CIS-CAT Assessor is being run, and the user can enter a 'y' or an 'n' for each.
##A sub-control survey question will be asked interactively if its answer line is commented out in this file (a # at the beginning of the line comments out that line).
##A sub-control survey question will use the saved answer from this file if its answer line is commented in below in this file (that is, the answer line is not preceded with a #).
##Answer lines look like: xccdf_org.cisecurity_value_1.6_var=y
##Question lines look like: Sub-Control 1.6   Question: Does your organization ensure that unauthorized assets are either removed from the network, quarantined, or the inventory is updated in a timely manner?
##Only answer lines should be modified, commented, or uncommented.  Question lines are provided only for the user's reference and should never be uncommented.
##By default, all answer lines are uncommented with a "no" value.  You should set each of these answers to the value that corresponds to your organization's current implementation of that sub-control.
##You may comment/uncomment any subset of answer lines that you wish (if you wish to answer some questions interactively but not others).
