      <xhtml:p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Azure Linux running on x86_64 platforms.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>This guide was developed and tested against Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes running Azure Linux on the Azure Compute Platform (ACP).</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user, and executed under the default bash version for the applicable distribution.  Operations performed using sudo instead of the root user, or executed under another shell, may produce unexpected results, or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.</xhtml:p>

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

            <xhtml:p>Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.</xhtml:p>

 If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 directory, this data will still consume space in           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 once the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 filesystem is mounted unless it is removed first.        </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:strong>Note</xhtml:strong>
: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

Kernel modules loaded directly via             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">insmod</xhtml:span>
 will ignore what is configured in the relevant             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf</xhtml:span>

You may also want to check             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/lib/modprobe.d/</xhtml:span>

By using             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/bin/false</xhtml:span>
 as the command in disabling a particular module serves two purposes; to convey the meaning of the entry to the user and cause a non-zero return value. The latter can be tested for in scripts. Please note that             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">insmod</xhtml:span>
 will ignore what is configured in the relevant             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf</xhtml:span>

 program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.            </xhtml:p>

                           <xhtml:p>
By design files saved to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system.                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 is ram based and all files stored to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 will be lost when the system is rebooted.                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/tmp</xhtml:span>
 not                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
.                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
Since the                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 or a separate partition. Running out of                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 (as with                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tmpfs</xhtml:span>
 which is RAM-based.                  </xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.

Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.

         <xhtml:p>While applying system updates and patches helps correct known vulnerabilities, one of the best ways to protect the system against as yet unreported vulnerabilities is to disable all services that are not required for normal system operation. This prevents the exploitation of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of possible threats to the resulting system. Additionally some services which should remain enabled but with secure configuration are covered as well as insecure service clients.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:p>IPv4 is based on 32-bit addressing, limiting it to a total of 4.3 billion addresses. IPv6 is based on 128-bit addressing and can support 340 undecillion, which is 340 trillion3 addresses. Having more addresses has grown in importance with the expansion of smart devices and connectivity. IPv6 provides more than enough globally unique IP addresses for every networked device currently on the planet, helping ensure providers can keep pace with the expected proliferation of IP-based devices.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used.</xhtml:p>

 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.          </xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could be significantly multiplied.</xhtml:p>

 forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the packet was valid.

 is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols (bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your system, you will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing.          </xhtml:p>

Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.          </xhtml:p>

When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>To provide a Host Based Firewall, the Linux kernel includes support for:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Netfilter - A set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack. A registered callback function is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.  Includes the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel modules. These modules are some of the significant parts of the Netfilter hook system.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
nftables - A subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames. nftables is supposed to replace certain parts of Netfilter, while keeping and reusing most of it. nftables utilizes the building blocks of the Netfilter infrastructure, such as the existing hooks into the networking stack, connection tracking system, userspace queueing component, and logging subsystem.              <xhtml:strong>Is available in Linux kernels 3.13 and newer</xhtml:strong>

            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>FirewallD - Provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables backend.  Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added support for acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program. firewalld supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles.</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>nftables - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the Linux kernel</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>iptables - Includes the iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables utilities for configuration Netfilter and the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel modules.</xhtml:li>

      <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
         <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
It is recommended that         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog </xhtml:span>
be used for logging (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logwatch </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) and         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
 be used for auditing (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aureport </xhtml:span>
providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference &lt;        <xhtml:a href="http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/">http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/</xhtml:a>
&gt; manual page for more information on configuring chrony.      </xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:strong>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:strong>
 There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>
). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640 </xhtml:span>
where         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp</xhtml:span>
 is the defined security group (in some cases         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>
).      </xhtml:p>

This section will cover the minimum best practices for the usage of           <xhtml:strong>either</xhtml:strong>
               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
               <xhtml:strong>or</xhtml:strong>
               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
. The recommendations are written such that each is wholly independent of each other and           <xhtml:strong>only one is implemented</xhtml:strong>
.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
If your organization makes use of an enterprise wide logging system completely outside of             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 or             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
, then the following recommendations does not directly apply. However, the principals of the recommendations should be followed regardless of what solution is implemented. If the enterprise solution incorporates either of these tools, careful consideration should be given to the following recommendations to determine exactly what applies.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Should your organization make use of both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
, take care how the recommendations may or may not apply to you.          </xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:h3>What is not covered</xhtml:h3>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>
Enterprise logging systems not utilizing             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 or             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
.
As logging is very situational and dependent on the local environment, not everything can be covered here.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
Transport layer security should be applied to all remote logging functionality. Both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">journald</xhtml:span>
 supports secure transport and should be configured as such.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>The log server. There are a multitude of reasons for a centralized log server (and keeping a short period logging on the local system), but the log server is out of scope for these recommendations.</xhtml:li>

The systems global                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 could override, but only making the file permissions stricter, what is configured in RSyslog with the                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">FileCreateMode</xhtml:span>
 directive. RSyslog  also has it's own                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">$umask</xhtml:span>
 directive that can alter the intended file creation mode. In addition, consideration should be given to how                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">FileCreateMode</xhtml:span>
 is used.                  </xhtml:p>
                           <xhtml:p>
Thus it is critical to ensure that the intended file creation mode is not overridden with less restrictive settings in                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/rsyslog.conf</xhtml:span>

, and           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rcp</xhtml:span>
. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.        </xhtml:p>

 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Match</xhtml:span>
, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If theses options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
The default             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Include</xhtml:span>
 location is the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/shh/sshd_config.d</xhtml:span>
 directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Include</xhtml:span>
 that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden.          </xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>
The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">Match</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:li>If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, RDomain, and Address (with RDomain representing the rdomain(4) on which the connection was received).</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as 192.0.2.0/24 or 2001:db8::/32. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address.  For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and 192.0.2.0/8, respectively.</xhtml:li>
                     <xhtml:li>Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword.</xhtml:li>

 To clarify, the two settings described below is only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they where abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">8.2p1</xhtml:span>
 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
The two options             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">man 5 sshd_config</xhtml:span>
:          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>

                     <xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.              </xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.  It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.              </xhtml:p>

In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
. Specifically, looking at the source code,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinately, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate.</xhtml:p>

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular authentication modules on UNIX systems.

Files for PAM are typically located in the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/pam.d</xhtml:span>
 directory. PAM must be carefully configured to secure system authentication. While this section covers some of PAM, please consult other PAM resources to fully understand the configuration capabilities.        </xhtml:p>

It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell.

The user file-creation mode mask (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rwxrwxrwx</xhtml:span>
), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (            <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rw-rw-rw-</xhtml:span>
). The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.          </xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

 or               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.            </xhtml:li>

. ie a               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask 027</xhtml:span>
.  This               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">umask</xhtml:span>
 would set a newly created directory with file mode               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">drwxr-x---</xhtml:span>
