   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

               <xhtml:p>
Logging to a remote host permits longer log retention than on-device logging.  This allows more flexible approaches to log processing, both in real time and retrospectively.  Real time log processing often includes log entries being used to trigger scripts or other events.    Finally, logging to an external host provides a second copy of all logs.  In the event that the firewall is compromised or logs are lost for whatever reason, a second copy of the logs are available.            <xhtml:br/>

Logging all infrastructure to a single central destination also allows the configuration of SIEM services, which facilitates correlation of firewall logs with logs of other infrastructure components.
For these reasons, most regulatory frameworks require remote, centralized logging for all critical infrastructure components.          </xhtml:p>

It is imperative that organizations log critical infrastructure appropriately, store and archive these logs in a central location, and have a robust set of tools to analyze logs both in real time and after the fact.</xhtml:p>

Storing logs on a remote host also allows for more flexible log searches and log processing, as well as many methods of triggering events or scripts based on specific log events or combinations of events.

Not having remote logs also puts many organizations outside of compliance with many regulatory frameworks.  Finally, not logging to a remote host leaves organizations without recourse in the event of a compromise of logs on the primary device.
It is imperative that organizations log critical infrastructure appropriately, store and archive these logs in a central location, and have a robust set of tools to analyze logs both in real time and after the fact.
Not encrypting log data as it transits the network allows an attacker to mount a "MiTM" (Monkey in the Middle) attack, which allows them to intercept and/or modify logs as they transit from the source to the destination.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced.
While current guidance emphasizes password length above frequent password changes, not enforcing password re-use guidance adds the temptation of using a small pool of passwords, which can make an attacker's job easier across an entire infrastructure.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>As encrypted Internet traffic continues to proliferate, WildFire becomes less effective unless it is allowed to act on decrypted content. For example, if a user downloads a malicious pdf over SSL, WildFire can only provide analysis if 1) the session is decrypted by the firewall and 2) forwarding of decrypted content is enabled. In today's internet, roughly 70-80% of all user traffic is encrypted. If Wildfire is not configured to analyze encrypted content, the effectiveness of Wildfire is drastically reduced.</xhtml:p>

The User-Agent option logs which browser was used during the web session, which could provide insight to the vector used for malware retrieval. The Referer option logs the source webpage responsible for referring the user to the logged webpage. The X-Forwarded-For option is useful for preserving the user’s source IP address, such as if a user traverses a proxy server prior to the firewall. Un-checking the Log container page only box produces substantially more information about web activity, with the expense of producing far more entries in the URL logs.

            <xhtml:p>Without flood protection, it may be possible for an attacker, through the use of a botnet or other means, to overwhelm network resources. Flood protection does not completely eliminate this risk; rather, it provides a layer of protection. Without a properly configured zone protection profile applied to untrusted interfaces, the protected / trusted networks are susceptible to large number of attacks. While many of these involve denial of service, some of these attacks are designed to evade IPS systems (fragmentation attacks for instance) or to evade basic firewall protections (source routing and record route attacks).</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>To avoid unintentionally exposing systems and services, rules allowing traffic from untrusted zones to trusted zones should be as specific as possible. Application-based rules, as opposed to service/port rules, further tighten what traffic is allowed to pass.
Similarly, traffic from trusted to untrusted networks should have a security policy set, with application-based rules.  A "catch-all" rule that allows all applications will also allow malware traffic.  The goal should be to understand both inbound and outbound traffic, permit what is known, and block all other traffic.</xhtml:p>

Setting application based rules on both inbound and outbound traffic ensures that the traffic on the protocol and port being specified is actually the application that you expect.  For outbound traffic, the days of "we trust our users" is well past us, that statement also implies that we trust the malware on the user workstations, which is obviously not the case.                <xhtml:br/>

For traffic from trusted to less trusted interfaces, the applications should be characterized over time, with the end goal being that all applications in in the rules, and a final "block all" rule is in place.
Not having this goal gives both attackers and malware the leeway they need to accomplish their goals.                <xhtml:br/>

Trusting only Port permissions to control traffic exposes an organization to "tunneling" style attacks that can exfiltrate data or facilitate Command and Control (C2) sessions.              </xhtml:p>

App-ID requires a number of packets to traverse the firewall before an application can be identified and either allowed or dropped. Due to this behavior, even when an application is defined in a security policy, a service setting of           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">any</xhtml:span>
 may allow a device in one zone to perform ports scans on IP addresses in a different zone. In addition, this recommendation helps to avoid an App-ID cache pollution attack.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Because of how App-ID works, configuring the service setting to "Any" allows some initial traffic to reach the target host before App-ID can recognize and appropriately restrict the traffic.

            <xhtml:p>Without SSL inspection, the firewall cannot apply many of its protection features against encrypted traffic. The amount of encrypted malware traffic continues to rise, and legitimate websites using SSL encryption are hacked or tricked into delivering malware on a frequent basis. As encryption on the Internet continues to grow at a rapid rate, SSL inspection is no longer optional as a practical security measure. If proper decryption is not configured, it follows that the majority of traffic is not being fully inspected for malicious content or policy violations. This is a major exposure, allowing delivery of exploits and payloads direct to user desktops.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>
The CA Certificate used for in-line HTTP Man in the Middle should be trusted by target users. For           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">SSL Forward Proxy</xhtml:span>
 configurations, there are classes of users that need to be considered.        </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or "IoT" (Internet of Things) devices.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as "Visitors" in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of "visitor" traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for the hosting organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.</xhtml:p>
