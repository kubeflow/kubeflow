## Overview

This directory contains the Kubeflow ksonnet [registry][2]. If you are unfamiliar with ksonnet, we recommend browsing [the official site][1] to gain more context.

## Usage

Please refer to the [Kubeflow guide](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/guides/)

## Library-specific Documentation

Each of the libraries in this directory has its own README.md. These are autogenerated from the metadata in their `parts.yaml` file, using the [`doc-gen` script][4].

Note that you can use the `ks` commands in your terminal to access this same documentation.
