## What is Kubeflow

[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) is the foundation of tools for AI platforms on Kubernetes.

Kubeflow projects address each stage in [AI lifecycle](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/architecture/#kubeflow-components-in-the-ml-lifecycle)
with support for best-in-class open source [tools and frameworks](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/architecture/#kubeflow-ecosystem).

Please refer to the official [documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/) for more information.
