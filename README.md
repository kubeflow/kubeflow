## Kubeflow Components

The Kubeflow ecosystem is composed of multiple open-source projects for each stage in
[the ML lifecycle](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/architecture/#kubeflow-components-in-the-ml-lifecycle).

Learn more about each project in [the Kubeflow documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/).
